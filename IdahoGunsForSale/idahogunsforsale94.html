		Use a ',' or 'or' to separate terms you wish to search for by using the 'or' condition. This means that a search result will be returned if a listing title and/or description matches either (or both) of your terms you have entered. You may string together as many 'or' terms as you wish. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;



(Example) Search for: red or blue&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

...will return all listings that have 'red' or 'blue' in the title and/or description.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;



Use an 'and' between terms for a multi-conditional search. This means that a result will be returned only if the title and/or description of a listing matches all of terms you have entered.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;



(Example) Search for: red and blue&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

...will return all listings that have 'red' and 'blue' in the title and/or description.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  



Tip: a search for 'some'&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

...would match 'here is something' in a partial word match, but would not in a whole word search. The term 'some' would match 'here is some stuff' in a whole word match.

	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</raw_content>
