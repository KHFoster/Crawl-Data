"Holy cow! You guys rock! All my stuff is now sold."

&lt;p&gt;





"I greatly appreciate your willingness to use your Alaska's List platform to

educate your viewers and thereby promote freedom. I have been assembling a book of wisdom for my boys (ages 3-10).  I've used many of the quotes from your Guns page, and I seem to never find the end of them. I feel their education in these matters is the hope of our nation."

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;



"You are awesome and I will tell people that Alaska's List is great! Thank you."

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;





"Thanks for all the help with our ad. Alaska's List is truly a great site!"

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;



"I deleted my Honda Foreman ad today because it was sold this morning. Thank you Alaska's

List for the great resource you provide for Alaskans."

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;



"I use your website often, and besides having a great product, your patriotism and constitutional conservatism encourages me. I always enjoy reading your comments [in the Guns section] on Alaska's List, and often I refresh the screen just to read more of your quotes and comments.  Our freedom will prevail as long as good men band together and speak out against overbearing governments. Less government = more freedoms. Keep up the good work."

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;







"Please pull the ad for the Bethel based M4-210 Maule, which was turned over to its new owner on March

30. The buyer turned out to be an old friend who lives next door to where I work, but he found out about

the plane by reading Alaska's List in the Anchorage airport.  Thanks for a successful sales experience. I

had numerous inquiries due to the ad."



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;



"The first person who called bought the safe. Amazing!"



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;



"I got my missing cat back thanks to Alaska's List. Thank you so much!"



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;



"I very much enjoy reading your editorials in the guns section. there is so much ignorance out there about the importance of our right to keep and bear arms."



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;



"You guys did a great job. What a clean, effective site."



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;



"Please remove the ad for my missing cat. I got him back yesterday, thanks to Alaska's List!"



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;



"Just wanted to say thank you guys so much! Your ad sold our trailer! Cheers."

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;



"Thanks so much for the help, my truck sold last night. Thank you guys and gals!"

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;



"Wow! Talk about warp speed on a holiday. I am impressed. Thanks again. You have my support."

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;



"Thank you as always for the services you provide."

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;



"I appreciate your web site very much and thank you for having such a great Alaska site. I use it all the time."

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;



"I really do love your site, the layout, ease, everything. Keep up the good work. Way better than Craigslist."

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;



"I placed two ads on your system on Saturday night and both items have been sold already. Great service!"

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;



"Thank you. You have an awesome site!!! Thank you for providing this service :)"



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;



"The proper owner of the handgun I found at Olson Creek.

He came forward thanks to the ad on Alaska's List.

Thank you for your community service."



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;



"I think this a great site! There's no flagging like CL."



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;



"I love this site and go on a couple times a day. I have close to a

100% success rate in selling items in here.  Way better than any other classified

sites out there.  Really like your Guns/Hunting section. Keep up the good work"

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;



"Thank you for the great service you guys provide. There's nothing else like it."

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

"I sure do appreciate your website. I've been able to start a very small business using it. If you go under, I go under. Thanks for providing the service."

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

"Yours is a user friendly, wonderful service, and I tell all my friends about it."

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

"Thank you sincerely for your services. I sold the box truck I listed quickly."



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;





"I really enjoy your site. I have gotten some great deals here."



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;



"Thank you for the assistance in getting my ads posted, in spite of my ignorance of the nuances of posting firearms for sale on Alaska's List. I truly appreciate everything your site does for the Alaskans that visit it."



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;



"We love it that you take the time and opportunity to remind people about the ideas this country was founded on. We appreciate and are thankful for the service you provide!"



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;



"Thank you very much. Also, thank you for your service and website. I use it all the time. One of the best out there."



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;



"Thank you very much. I do appreciate what you do. Thank you also for giving Alaskan

gun owners a place to trade online."



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;



"I enjoy your site because there aren't all the flakes like on craigslist. I see the

car sellers are migrating to your site now. Craigslist by owner section has been

ruined by these dealer/resellers posing as private owners. Keep Alaska's List clean!

Just my two cents."



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;



"The rifle sold today. Thanks for a great service to Alaskans."



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;



"Thank you for the Featured Ad. RZR has been sold. They bought it after seeing it

on your site."



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;



"Just a thanks to Alaska's List, sold my kayaks last night! Cash! Appreciate your service!"



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;



"I would like to thank you for providing ALL Alaskans with an awesome website for us to buy and sell any and all items here... I reside in anchorage and have family in the rural villages and we all use this site... many of us had a need to be able to buy or sell firearms rifle etc. and you guys have helped us to make life easier to get by... subsistence hunting/fishing is our way of life and having you here to assist us in finding the means to provide us with the ability to get the tools we need to carry on our traditions and that subsistence lifestyle is the greatest blessing we could have asked for... from all of my family, relatives and my self... THANK YOU!"



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;



"Thank you for your website! I sold my travel trailer in less than 6 hours after I posted it for sale on Alaska's List yesterday! I feel confident in the integrity of Alaska's List and I will use your services again, plus recommend other Alaskans to your site. Thank you, One Happy Camper-less Customer!"



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;



"The ad turned out great, thank you! Great service."



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

"I don't understand why people can't see CommuList for what it is. In my opinion, it's a facsist anti-trust operation, owned by Sleeze-Bay, which pretends to be 'communitarian' in nature by giving away free advertising to the masses, but really, it's just a way for Sleeze-Bay to keep sites like yours from ever rising-up to compete against their online auction monopoly, which hauls-in 1% of everything sold there. After all, no legitimate corporation could ever make money by giving it's products or services away for free, so obviously, Sleeze-Bay must be giving away free advertising at CommuList for some other reason."



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;



"All my puppies found new homes you guys helped tremendously with this. Thank you again!"



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;



"I have already, in just a few days, had two registrations, crediting Alaska's List as the way they were referred to me. Thank you for your excellent service!"



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;



"The aircraft sale has just finalized. It sold within a week of advertising on Alaska's List. Thank you"



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;



"Thank you! We have used Alaska's List since it was started. Your site has been very good for our

business, and personal use."



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;



"Sold my fishing reels. Thank You VERY MUCH for your awesome website/service. Thank you (again)."



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;



"Thanks for providing a wonderful service to our state, Alaska's List is very appreciated! Many years of great service with you folks."



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;



"I really appreciate you helping me with my ad. It has made my life a lot simpler. You have a very good service. I tell everybody I know about it. I tell them if want a no nonsense place to advertise or sell

something go to Alaska's List."



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;



"It's amazing! My gun sold after only an hour. Wow!"



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;



"I look at and use Alaska's List all the time for things that I am looking for, and I want to thank you for putting it together."

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

"All items were sold on your site. Great results!"



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

"Hey we LOVE you nice folks at Alaskaslist!!!"



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

"Thank you for helping me sell my couch. I greatly appreciate it!"



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

"Thank you from everyone who uses your site. It's so nice to have a place other than Craigslist to shop and sell. Your site has become a household name in AK."



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

"Thank you for your excellent website and the service it provides! It is a credit to the industry."



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

"Thank you very much for your site! Sold the snowmachine!! Alaska forever!!! Keep up with the great site you have, I'll post in the near future."



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

"You guys do a great job. Thank you for your efforts."

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

"Thanks for your wonderful service! Great job your doing also! I'm so glad it's available for Alaska."



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

"Thank you for helping me sell my Jeep!"



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

"Thanks again your customer service/support is awesome! You saved me a whole bunch of hassles."



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

"I love Alaska's List. What a great venue to buy/sell/trade stuff, and meet some

really nice people!"



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

"I sold the motorhome yesterday! Didn't get my asking price, but that's okay. Thank you for being here for us!"



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

"My pistol sold in the Guns/Hunting section. Thank you for the great advertising service for selling stuff."



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

"Your help, as usual, has been a wonderful help and service. GREAT JOB! I do not know why anyone would ever

be satisfied to use your competitor's site. Yours is well organized, easy to use,

and just plain awesome. I remember when you first started and chatted with you... How Alaskaslist has grown! Thank you. And, again, good work!"

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;



"One common denominator throughout almost every town on the road system in Alaska is Alaska's List."

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

"People love your site. I would be hard pressed to find a more widespread venue to advertise."





&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

"I post on Alaska's List pretty frequently and really value your website as an avenue to advertise what I have for sale. It works. Thank you."



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

"Your support of our 2nd Amendment is the reason for my continued patronage."



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

"Thank you for giving us a good honest website."

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

"This is my third time listing an item on your site and I think it's great!"

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

"My canoe sold today and I just want to say thanks."

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

"Hey. Thank you so much for setting up this great site. This is going to make my move up to Alaska a lot easier. Your list rocks!"

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

"The vehicle has sold because of the site. Thank you very much."



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

"You have the best listing site in the State of Alaska."



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

"Thank you for taking the time to keep our Alaska List clear and up to date.  Also, thank you for helping me with my ads. You are team players! AK4Ever!"



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

"I didn't realize you guys actually have to review every ad.  Wow! You must never get any sleep. Thanks for running this wonderful website. I really love it."



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

"Your site worked extremely well, and I am sure I will be using it again soon."



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

"We listed five items and sold them all in two days making $1700. Thats more than

what we have made from a garage sale and with out the normal fake scammer responses

you get from craigslist. Just two minutes after posting one of our ads I got a

call and sold the item! Now if my house sells on Alaska's List I'll elevate you

guys to God Status and buy you a steak dinner!"



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

"Thank you for providing such a great service. I have enjoyed reading Alaska's List several times a day."



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

"Alaska's List is the best thing that's come to the horse world of Alaska."



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

"Thanks Alaska's List for helping us sell a D21-P dozer. The gentleman that purchased it was a really nice guy, and it was a smooth transaction."



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

"I was able to sell an item quickly again by using your Featured Ad option. It took only two days before I got a reasonable offer."



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

"Thank you. The Tahoe is now sold! That was fast! I will use this site more in the future. Very impressed."



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

"I do appreciate you guys keeping your site free of spam and policing its content. Thank you."



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

"I really appreciate you having a clean site for us normal Alaskans!"



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

"I'm glad to see Alaska'a List is still very much alive and well. It was only about 5 minutes after posting my ad that I had a buyer for my rifle tonight. Wow! To be 100% honest, I'm pinching pennies and was a little skeptical at first about posting an ad for my business under services. However, after I saw how fast the response was on my rifle, I went straight home and posted my business ad. Keep up the good work."



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

"Your service is wonderful. Thanks a million."



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

"Congratulations on a good site. I use it regularly both to buy and sell."



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

"I think this is the third ad I've posted with you guys, and I'm thankful for your service. It's always been a pleasant experience. Thank you very much."



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

"Thank you for you attentive and prompt service. You and your site are fantastic, and truly rock!"



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

"Thanks for the reads everyday. I typically go on Alaskaslist about four times daily to check out firearms for sale. I look forward to the words of wisdom from our

founding fathers and other insightful individuals. Keep up the good work."

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

"Thank you for a wonderful site. Your list generates much of my business."



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

"My plane was sold within a couple weeks of placing a featured ad on your site."



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

"That 'other list' is a pain in the butt, but your list kicks butt. Love it! Thanks."



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

"It literally sold in under 1 minute after I posted. Thank you for making it happen."



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

"I have sold all three of my items. Thanks for your help. Alaska's List is great!"



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

"I just recently moved to Alaska. I was browsing and posting an ad on Alaska's List, and came across your article when browsing firearms. I wanted to personally thank you or as

much as I could via e-mail for your words of wisdom and exemplary display of patriotism and a confirmation of a backbone that supports what the Constitution is about, also to

have the vision to see around the Washington politics and reveal the agenda of the globalist pigs. I appreciate your efforts and a sincere thank you from a fellow patriot."



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

"Thank you for the great service that Alaska's List gives to Alaskans!"

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

"Thank you so much for your website. We are happy with the results of our ad we put on Alaska's List."

"Thanks to your Great Web Site, I sold my American Champion and will have my friend that is selling a Cessna 185 and another American Champion list with you. Thanks again."



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

"I greatly appreciate Alaska's List and all the work you do. Thank you very much."



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

"First of all, thank you for a great resource. Once again, you have served us well. Second, I have successfully sold our Suburban."



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

"Thank you Alaska's List for providing an easy way to sell my aircraft."



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

"Thanks for being a great sell site. We sold our truck within one week of listing. Keep up the great work and we always tell all of our friends the best alaska site for selling is Alaska's List"



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

"We just wanted to say thank you for having such a nice website for us to use! Craig's List is so awful now, with so many scams. It's been a real pleasure being able to use

your classifieds, especially to re-home our Malamute. We found a very nice couple to take her, and it was comforting to know we were dealing with real people!"



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

"We sold the items today, less than 24 hours after posting. We can see why your site is as popular as it is. Thank you."



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

"Thank you for your site. It is a wonderful forum. I don't understand how you make money by operating it, but you are quite generous for doing so anyway."



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

"Allow me to thank you for your excellent website, and the service it provides."



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

"Made my trade just as I'd hoped. Thanks Alaska's list! The site is just the greatest!"



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

"One thing I have found with Alaska's List is if you need help it's there fast. That is a great service!"



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

"Your classifieds yield results! It only took 4 hrs on your site to sell my tires! Made the mistake of posting on the brand X web site, nothing but scammers and endless questions for trades. Thanks."



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

"I just sold my inflatable raft and mailed it to Montana. Your ad works Outside as well as in-state. Thanks much for your service. I'll definitely use it again."





&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

"I listed our family dog, a Rottweiler/Retriever mix with a sparrow brain. Over 200 people took the time to check my ad. Now, he's back home. He's lost weight, was freezing cold, but otherwise, he's his good old self. Thank you everyone."





&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

"Thanks for a great site. Sold our tractor, as well as many other things in the past!"



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

"I have had good response and will use this list in the future. Thank you very much for your time and effort."



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;



Alaska's List is so much easier to use than Craigslist.



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;



"All of our puppies have homes now thanks to you guys!"



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;



"I have a serious question. I just moved from Alaska about 6 months ago and I really

miss Alaska's List. No other state has a exclusive service like this. I mean there is

craigslist and ebay but they are so loaded with scammers and other crap. When will you be starting something like this for say PA?"



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;



"Thanks for the top notch site! It beats Craigs List hands down! I hate all the filth on their site and really like having a site like yours that is Alaskan and includes guns, hunting, trapping and all the other normal stuff!"



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;



"Thanks. Sold the item today. Buyer saw it on your site."



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;



"Thank you for your site. I'm moving out of state soon, and have a lot of stuff to sell. Your Featured Ad option is a no-brainer, and well worth supporting your site."



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

"I placed my first ad on Alaska's List last night and sold my tires and rims today. A total no BS experience, so thank you. It was very easy to place the ad and delete it when I needed to."



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;



"About 3 minutes after I hit the submit button, I got a call from a gentlemen in Anchorage who drove directly to my home in Wasilla and purchased my generator! You rock!"



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;



"All are sold, and thanks so very much for your web site. My family loves it."



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;



"Thank you. We have had 100% success with all of the ads that we posted."



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;



"Always good to know you guys are kicking ass, thanks for helping me."



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;



"My trailer has now been sold thanks to you guys! I appreciate your service."



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;



"Great job man! Glad to see finally see someone take on Craigslist."



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

"Thanks. I sold both of my trucks on your awesome site!"



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

"First I'd like to say what you're doing is great! There are so many trolls

on craigslist, it's completely ruined that site. Alaska's List is WAY better!"



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

"Thank you for Alaska's List. It is a great site for

buying and selling items in Alaska."



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

"Approximately five hours

after my ad was posted, my ammunition was sold.  Thank you for the good service

you provide."



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

"I sold

my boat thanks to you're site. You guys are the bomb. I love Alaska's List and will continue to use

it to buy and sell. Thanks again"



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

"A big thanks to Alaska's List. It has been a great service. I just retired and moved to Missouri after 23 great years in Alaska."



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

"Thanks so much for all your hard work and help to us here in Alaska."



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

"I sure wish you guys were in Nebraska. When we come to Alaska we shop for a week on

your site for things to get back to the Husker state. Last trip a 30.06 and a heavy

duty Interstate trailer that made its way back to Nebraska. Thanks for a real,

honest to goodness site."



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

"I sold a 4 drawer file cabinet thanks to the ad I placed on Alaska's list. Thanks for your help."



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

"Thanks for a nice community service. I am starting to use Alaska's List more than Craigs List. Good for you!"



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

"Thanks. This a very good site to have access to."



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

"Love this site,  I don't even go to craigs list anymore, Alaska's List is so much more user friendly for Alaskans and doesn't have all that dating/prostitution crap that clogs up craigs list."



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

"I sold it on my first call! Thanks for providing such a nice service, and one not being afraid to run firearm ads."



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

"Thanks for your site. It's great for us small business folks and for every Alaskan as well."



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

"I've told all of my friends about Alaska's List!"



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

Thank you for this awesome site. I have used your site to buy and sell things over the years and I'm very happy with it."

"Thank you so much. I just sold the truck we posted yesterday! Alaska's List worked for us. Now we can stop worrying about our finances for a while."



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

"Just found your site. It's great to finally have an alternative to Craigslist, which I've always hated to no end because of the porn there. And knowing that Ebay is an owner of Craigslist never really set right with me either. I hate cartels like that. It seems If they don't get you coming (to Ebay), they get you going (to Craigslist). Anyway, give 'em hell. That's what they deserve."



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

"Thanks to Alaska's List, our cat, Snickers found the perfect country home she was looking for."

Your competition is....bunk!"

"You're providing one of the best deals out there."



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

"At least you listen! I send e-mails to your competitor and haven't heard back. Won't use them anymore. I like dealing with a real person!"



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

"Wooohoooooo - U da man! Viva Alaska! Huzzah Alaskaslist!"



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

"I don't envy you having to mess with stuff like this, but glad you do."





&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

"Thanks!  Appreciate you getting right on it and fixing it. You got a great site!  Better than Craig's List!"

"I got more interest than I thought I'd get, so am really happy.  I love your site and am so happy that you are willing to maintain it for us.  It's such a nice option to Craig's List.  I don't even go there anymore!!"



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

"I really like the fact that I don't get all the spam and nonsense from Alaskaslist

that we got from CL.  Thanks for a great site. God bless"



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;



"Thank you. I really appreciate it and like the addition of the business logo to the one photo. Thanks for your time."



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;



"I love your site, and think you do a wonderful job of keeping it wholesome.  It's a first class site.  Thanks so much for making it available to our community."



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;



"Wow! Thanks guys for the design you added to my add by combining photos and my companys name. I'm really impressed and am telling everyone I know about Alaskaslist. Thanks so much."



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;



"Thanks for your great service this is the second horse that I have sold on Alaskas list."



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;



"We listed our Ford Explorer SUV for sale on CL's and AK list.....we got TONS of

spam/scam emails from CL, but a real person called and bought the car from the ad we

had on alaskaslist (and no scam emails)...thank you!"



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;



"Thanks for the quick responses. I luv your website."



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;



"Some months ago I listed a '98 Honda CRV for $4800.  I sold it today for

my asking price! I would also like to say that your customer service was excellent; and

that I only received well-intentioned serious inquiries through this

site.  It is VERY MUCH appreciated!!  If I could yell from the house

tops that your site is so much better than Craigslist-I would!!!  Thank

you again! And a happy new year!!"





&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;



"The item that was listed is now sold via your website (which I happen to really enjoy and check very often). Thanks a bunch, Alaskaslist.com team!"



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;



"I really like the

layout of your website, we are enjoying using it!!! "



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;



"Apparently I have you to thank for my dogs!!  Alaska's List is great!!  I

found mine and Dennis' 9 month old dachshunds here in April of 2009 and just

found Miki's new best friend Goofy on here last night, a 9 week old

mini-dachshund!!  Thanks!"



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;



"I know someone else who has just divorced themselves from 'the other list' because of their asinine flagging system. good on 'this list'."



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;



"Thanks very much! You guys are providing a great Alaskan website for us."



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;



"You have a "Great" Program.  I have used Craigslist for years, but yours is truly a

fantastic asset for getting the word out. (better than Craigslist!)"



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;



"I want to thank you for this website.  We had 15 puppies and

were able to sell all of them.  Our biggest fear was not finding homes for our pups,

and your site allowed us the peace of mind that we so desperately needed. Again, thank you, and God bless you and your website."



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;



"Thanks again for Alaska's List. As we all know, Craigslist sucks (literally) LOL!"



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;



"Thanks for the great site! I just sold my 2008 Polaris Ranger. Keep up the good work!"



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;



"I Love Alaska's list!"



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;



"Thank you very much. This mode of advertisement is successful."



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;



"Just wanna say thanks for your site its much more user friendly than craigslist plus

by using your featured ad the things ive had for sale went pretty fast thanks

again."



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;



"I use your site a lot, and I appreciate how user friendly it is. The ADN site is a

nightmare in comparison. Keep up the good work. You take care."



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;



"Thank you so much for the availablity of Alaskaslist."



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;



"I just wanted to say thanks. I have had 466 hits and one

possible buyer but he backed out at the last minute.. Maybe summertime is

a better time for selling a cargo van!   Anyways, you have a really great

website."



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;



"Thanks. I think the site is a great tool for Alaskans."



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;



"Thank you for adding the picture to my ad. That's very cool. Oh, I like it

here better than I do at that other 'LIST.'"



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;



"Your site is the bomb. I use it to buy stuff all the time. It's so easy to use, and I like it a lot better than

the Nazi Flagger Witches' site."



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;



"Glad things are going well for you - our household sure appreciates the

service you provide! My husband is always on the lookout for good deals

on guns, ATVs and other things."



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;



"We've sold it. :) Your website is great by the way, love it! Thanks much."



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;



"We are so lucky that our missing Australian Shepherd has been found.  Thank you soooo much for your help."



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;



"I have run several ads here since finding out about this website from another user

of the 'C' site. Results were I found the trailer I wanted, sold my items, and best

of all got a great job from the jobs wanted section. Great local site!"





&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;



"I sold the firearm. Thank you very much. You guys have an awesome site. Keep up the good work."



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;



"Hello, and thank you for your site! I sold the cribbage board. Thank you so

much for your help."



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;



"Many thanks for your assistance and this great site.  Keep up the good work!"



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;



"Can't thank you enough.  This is the only ad site I use now.  On the "other" site,

everything gets flagged for no reason...just because people are bored I guess.  Your

site is the one and only for me from now on."



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;



"Your site works great. I sold my item in one day, Thank You."



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;



"Wow, thanks!  I appreciate your service, and I am promoting your site to everyone I

know!"



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;



"Images sure do sell adds better.  I did it on my last add. Got to thank

you as well. Cause through alaskas list I've got 4 other contracts"



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;



"We did sell the trailer, and very much appreciate having your site to use.  We love

that you are giving the big boys some competition."



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;



"I just looked at the post I put on your forum a day, or two ago...I

feel very humbled, and grateful that you have placed it at the top of

your list...I am quite speechless, and want you to know that I see

what you did, and I deeply appreciate your kindness. Thank you so much."



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;



"Thank you SO much for creating this site! I have gotten so tired of all the

craigslist crap! The rants and raves, the flagging.. Its sucks! You guys rock! Keep

on truckin'!"



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;



"The items sold. Thanks for the great service."



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;



"We sold our home! Thanks for your site.....It works!!!!!"



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;



"Great job with the web site, I have been visiting your site for some

time now, I have bought things thru your site and sold things thru

your site. I find my self visiting your site sometimes 3 times a day. Thanks again keep up the

awesome work."



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;



"Thank you for starting this list.  I have a couple Icelandic yearlings for sale.  I

posted them on Craig's List and someone kept flagging them for deletion.  I live in

Sutton and commute to Anchorage every day.  I don't have a lot of extra time and it

was very frustrating to have to keep redoing the postings.  I really appreciate all

the time and effort you put into your list."



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;



"Your Alaska's List works.  I listed 2 Old Caterpillar Dozers

for my friend,  who has no computer. They  finally sold.  Took

awhile, but buyers came around!"



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;



"It's no longer important if

we get our Cooperative Extension programs in the newspaper.  If it's on

Alaskaslist, there will be a crowd.  I had 25 people show up for my

chicken program in Talkeetna...in little Talkeetna because of your website!!"



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;



"Great site the

parts sold within weeks!"



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;



"Thank you for your time

...lots of kudos to you and Amber on a great site!!!!"



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;



"Thank you so much for your great website!"



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;



"Thanks. This is the best free trade site in Alaska. Also, the editing is awesome. We got more hits on our Alaskaslist page than all others combined."



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;



"This was the first time that I had used it, and it worked great. Sure beats craigslist."



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;



"Thanks for putting up this website for Alaska.  It is great. Keep up the good works!"



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;



"People in Alaska are getting sick of Craigslist. It was convenient for a while but now we see that it is yet another liberal ploy for control.  He has shoved a lot of

small newspapers out of business and now has a very powerful tool to use for social

control."



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;



"I know they are scared of you because I posted your site several times on the RnR section of Craigslist and lost my accounts associated with the posts."



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;



"Being self-employed I know it is a real struggle to get something up and running. I believe, however, if you keep at it you will displace Craigslist in Alaska within three years."



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;



"What i really want to compliment you on is the immediate response i get from my emails. very impressive! - thank you for your customer service program and to the folks that make it work."



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;



"No, Thank YOU! It sold in record time! :)"



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;



"Thank you very much. Fast service. Great site. Great site. Just found it this week."



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;



"Wow. One in 1.8 million: I told my fiancee I was special! Thanks for maintaining the site. It provides an excellent service to the Alaskan community."



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;



"Thanks again for putting together and running alaskaslist, it's a

wonderful site."



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;



"First of all I want to thank you for creating alaskaslist. It is such a refreshing

change from that OTHER site!! I have bought and sold many things off

your site and had GREAT transactions everytime."



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;



"Nice job. Thank you for the AK list!"



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;



"Thank you for such an awesome website, it gets results!"



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;



"I did find a Bengal Kitten thanks to Alaskaslist. It

works!!!"



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;



"I just wanted to say that I love this and have used it myself to sell things.  This

was a much needed site for Alaska and you have done such good job on it."



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;



"I just wanted to say good for you for actually doing something. Many people talk

about it and never do anything. I'm not from Alaska, actually I live in Indiana, but

came across the story from The Anchorage Daily News while I was looking up flag info

on Craigscrap.com....oops, I meant Craigs....you know. Anyways, just wanted to say

congrats to you."



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;



"The featured add program worked great. My sled sold the first day. Thank you for making a great product."



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;



"Thank you once again for your great and valuable service.

It's nice to be able to tell people about alaskaslist, and I'm glad when I

have the opportunity to do so. I'd guess that happens at least a few times

each week. I wish you continued success and hope this endeavor becomes a

financially self-sustaining and rewarding project."



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;



"It is sold.  Thankyou for ALASKAS LIST!!!!!!!!!"



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;



"Just wanted to thank you for all of your help and assistance.  You've been a pleasure to work with...

Again, thanks so much."



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;



"I posted ads on Craigslist - Anchorage and got no interest..and a lot of spam.  Then I found out about

Alaskaslist and I sold all three of my items in less than a month!  Thanks for setting this up!"



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;



"Thank you so much!  The ad looks great!  We have gotten an amazing response from AlaskasList!  We greatly appreciate your immediate attention!"



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;



"I had someone respond to my listing on Alaskaslist for tires. It worked out great. Thanks so much for your tremendous service."



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;



"Thanks for running our ad! The August 30 trail ride was a success! We appreciate the service that you offer to our community."



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;





"Thank You Alaskaslist We sold our lot!!! Your site is very user friendly, and just enough options for placing an ad."



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;



"I sold my amp yesterday. Thanks so much for your web site and the chance to sell with you folks."



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;



"Thank you so much for your service! Love you sight and so glad you got this going! Cheers!"



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;



"The sale is finished. Thank You for your service and we look forward to using it again."



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;



"I like your advertising method better than any other site I've tried. Alaska's List is classifieds done right."



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;



"Thanks for having a site where posting guns is okay. I absolutely love the Alaskalist!!!"



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;



"I have gotten some feed back for my two year old [horse] using this site, and I am happy to

have a place where I can put my ad and not feel like there is going to be drama

surrounding it!"



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;



"About 1 month ago I purchased a feature add on your aviation link to

promote a program we developed for growing grass on runways.  We

received front page coverage with the Anchorage Daily News, got a 3

minute story on Channel 2 out of Anchorage and got the story picked up

by the Associated Press.  With all of that publicity, it still did not

match the response we got from advertising on Alaskaslist.  Thought you

might like to know that!



Interestingly enough, I also advertised on Craigslist and did not

receive a single response from their website."



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;



"Thanks very much for fixing my title, and so fast!  Word is spreading about

Alaskaslist and everyone talks about how awesome it is.  Thanks for your

work and thanks for keeping it such a high quality website.  Don't change!"



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;



"Thanks so much for everything!  I added a link to Alaska's List on our website, We've gotten a great response from any and all ads that we've posted with you. Thanks again!!!"



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;



"Thanks for providing us with this service, by the way. I really am thankful for this

site."



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;



"Thanks for the ad and website help and for everything else you do... AlaskasList is

definitely a much needed commodity to Alaskans!"



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;



"I have sold my 94 winchester 30/30 I posted just a bit ago. Thank you for alaskaslist!"



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;



"I posted two pups passed on to me from the village on your website and

CL today.  As a result through you,  Sasha  found a great home

today.  Marty is still looking, but hopeful.   I ran the same ad for

the same $75 adoption fee (I have $330 in vet bills just to bring the

pups  up to speed) and was flagged at CL.   Thank you for starting AKlist

and rock on. Many thanks"



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;



"Thanks!

 We have sold three tractors this week. Thanks for your great publicity."



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;



"Sold the boat! Thanks for being there with a better option for Alaskans."





&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;



"I sold the 1987 Jaco pop up camper. I appreciate using your site and will recommend this to my

friends and



neighbors."



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;



"Thanks. BTW, my  Bobcat sold and I'm a happy camper. Full price so I can eat

tonight!  ;-)"



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;



"Thank you so much for letting my post be on here. You guys are way then

craigs list. I had no spam calls or emails. I will use you guys from now on.

Thank you."



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;



"Thank you for the help. I am a life long alaskan and really appreciate this

web site as i am sure a lot of people do."



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;



"I sold the one mattress with the air pump today soon after posting

my ad.  Thank you all so much for the use of this website."



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;



"I'm sure you guys have heard this alot but your service is the

GREATEST....always on the ball,   we have sold several items this summer

thanks to you and ALASKASLIST..."



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;



"Thank you very much for this site. We sold our 4-wheeler in just a few days after

puting it on this site. Thank you again."



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;



"Thank you so much for your website.  I was able to fill the position I

advertised with a high quality employee.  Thanks again."



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;



"DJ and I have put DJ's old truck and a diamond ring we had on your

Alaskaslist site. Both sold within days of posting our ads. The site is GREAT! We

didn't get any spam ads and everybody who called was local. Also you had our ad up

in minutes. We are Alaskaslist addicts and are constantly recomending it to our

friends(who have also had great experiences)."



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;



"I WOULD LIKE TO SAY YOUR SITE IS (THE BEST

SINCE SLICED INTERNET BREAD!) Godbless. Keep up the great work that

you do."



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;



"Thank-you so much for your sight. I sold my lawn mower."



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;



"Hi. This survival suit sold today thanks to your site. Keep up the great work. Thanks,"



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;



"Thank you very much for this site. We sold our 4-wheeler in just a few days after

puting it on this site. Thank you again."



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;



"I really like Alaskalist.com and have made several purchases off the listings.

Thanks for such a great place to list items and shop without have to deal

with the problems of the other list."



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;



"I really appreciate

your starting Alaskaslist -- it was a very needed correction for craigslist."



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;



"Hey! thanks for the great service! We sold our boat thanks to your wonderful

service.

Your help was really appreciated! Will recommend and use your services again.

Enjoy the summer when you aren't chained to the computer."



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;



"I really appreciate

your attention to detail and helping customers you are great thank you so much I

dont think I have every had someone so nice do something like this for me I don't

know how to thank you"



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;



"Love your site. i've used it a few times and i dont rcv scam

crud like you would on brand x site."



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;



"I just wanted to thank you for letting us use you place for the free add. It

helped us find our dog a new home. Keep up the good work."



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;



"I read your story on the web and I was very intrigued by the idea of

creating Alaskaslist as a response to the unreasonable rules governing

Craigslist. Having a lot of experience in software development (including

several years at Microsoft) I can honestly say that your coding skills and

the execution are very impressive! I love the simplicity, neat design and

your attention to detail."



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;



"Hey, you've got a great site and we've gotten some really good deals from it!  Thank

you so much!"



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;



"Thanks for the listing! I sold my mower this afternoon."



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;



"Thank you very much for your service. You guys rock."



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;



"By the way, great site.  Thanks for giving us another

option outside of craigslist.  It has been a joy to use..."





&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;



"I sold my table from the ad on your site, and I was very pleased as a first time user on the

quick response from the ad, the ease of listing and the quality of your

site. I will let others know of this."



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;



"I just wanted to say thank you to alaskas list for your service. I have sold my car."



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;



"I thought your site was great when it first came out... and

still think it's great.

AL is top dog in AK.

YO"



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;



"You have created such an awesome place for Alaskans to buy, sell and

trade.... thank you, thank you, thank you!  PS   I especially like the hit lister."



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;



"Thank you though for taking care of us posters, I certainly do appreciate this site for those caring, thoughtful qualities."



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;



"I would like to take a moment to say THANK YOU for this website. I have done allot of cleaning out of items from my garage on it. I too am a webmaster of a personal website of my Alaska fishing pictures (as a hobby) and I know it is costing some money... Again, thank you for running this!"



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;



"Love the site."



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;



"Great site. Your providing a great service to Alaska folks. Thanks."



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;



"I posted an ad on Alaskaslist.com and got a good response, much more than ever from craigslist. And no spam cr*p like I get immediately from ads posted on craigslist."



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;



"I like the look of your site, and I especially like the option of paying a few bucks for premium exposure. That's fair."



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;



"By the way, great site.  Thanks for giving us another option outside of craigslist.  It has been a joy to use..."



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;



"I sold the stroller in like 11 minutes yesterday. You guys are awesome. Alaskaslist rocks!"



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;



"Thank you for your help.  Great site, we are telling everybody about you."



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;



"I read your article in the Anchorage Daily News and I am always in favor of

a person who finds a new way to improve up on a idea that has become so

political.  CONGRATULATIONS"



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;



"I thought I would drop you a line to tell you that your website is very

professionally done with most ads having a lot of information."



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;



"I just want to tell you how wonderful the Alaskaslist is to have available!"



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;



"We sold our motorhome yesterday. Thank you for a great place to advertise."



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;



"Thanks very much for the site. Great site, and all ours! WooHoo!"



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;



"...by the way I love the website-so much better without all

the nonsense and garbage from C/L!!!!  Thanks!!!"



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;



"Thank you for all the trouble that you have gone through, and thank you for

this service that you provide.



It is a wonderful site and my husband and I both check it everyday, for all

the new goodies posted. LOL."



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;



"Thanks very much for the site. Great site, and all ours! WooHoo!"



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;



"Thx. U r awesome. Craigslist can't hold a candle to Alaskaslist. Life to the

American's rights, YO"



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;



"I love your site, it's really clean, no profanity, no flagging. You've got the best site! I sold my

baby lovebirds and my jeep. Thank you so much for making a wonderful site!"



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;



"I just want you to know how much we like your site.  It is very well done and i'm using it more and more."



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;



"Thank You, ALASKASLIST!!... You have just made me a very nice profit on a backhoe sale."



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;



"Thank you so much for your great buying and selling tool. Build it, and they will

come."



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;



"Hello. love your Alaskaslist.com, I just sold the Glock 20C and the SKB 12 Ga this afternoon... I

 will look in the gun safe to see what else I can  post today. Thanks again for your assistance."



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;



"I remembered your case from last winter. I think it was November '08 when I saw your attempts to post the dog house ads. I

recall I posted a note in support of your ads back then. Well, anyway, good for your for taking the bull by the horns and creating this site.

I'm guessing it's gonna be big! I'll help spread the word on Facebook to my AK

friends. God bless!"



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;



"Your website is AWESOME... love the way you have so many categories."



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;



"Just wanted to let you know I appreciate your website.  Sold my daughters (outgrown) 4 wheeler in

record time."



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;



"After trying to deal with craigslist for a few months, and telling tons of people I hate that they don't

sell guns, an NCO in my unit told me about the gun he bought from "alaskaslist." I was confused, and

then he showed it to me, and I've been in love since. I tell all my fellow soldiers about your site, and

constantly copy/paste/email them links. It's like a drug: I was fine before I had it, but now I don't

know what I'd do without it!"



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;



"Good morning. Great site. your providing a great service to alaska folks. Thanks"



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;



"Thank you!! My phone has been ringing off the proverbial hook since I placed my ad. I'll recommend you to others."



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;



"Sure appreciate this List.  I've told lots of folks about it who hadn't heard about your dilemma with

the other List.  When I tell the story, almost everyone say "But, where else would you list dog boxes?"

Ah, Alaskans!"





&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;



"Thank you for your personalized service and great website."



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;



"Thanks for the quick replies... I love the website. Nice to have a local alaskan website to use. Keep up the good work."



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;



"I just realized the story behind Alaska's List - awesome job! Thank you so much for creating our

uniquely Alaskan list! I've "collected" abandoned rabbits for over a year now, some pregnant, and trying

to find homes for the babies on CL was nearly impossible. With my AList ad, I found homes for 5 bunnies

already and met the NICEST people in the process. Thank you again for creating this forum. All thumbs up

(incl. rabbit and dog thumbs :-)"



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;



"I'm already in love with Alaskaslist...thank you for making it so much easier than Craigslist, which frustrates me no end...nuff said...thanks."



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;



"Thank you for having your list &amp;amp; keeping it clean."



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;



"It's awesome to see something made to help out Alaskans! Kudos!"



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;



"Thanks. I love the new Alaskan Website.  Keep up the good work!"



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;



"Thanks for the service you provide I am impressed with how effective Alaskalist is. I generally hate to

sell stuff but Have really enjoyed the ease of selling using your service."



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;



"Keep up the great work on your Alaska website."



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;



"This is exactly what Alaska needed!!  I've completly converted to Alaskaslist. Thanks, you have all my

support!!"



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;



"Hi. Just deleted my ad, the seller signed closing documents today! Thanks very much for the service."



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;



"This site is getting better and better every time I check it! Keep up the good work!"



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;



"Just wanted to say you folks did a wonderful job developing and promoting this site. It is very clean and easy to use. It's nice to know we Alaskans have a place to go that was designed for Alaskans. Well done!"



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;



"Looking forward to CL crumbling under it's own depravity."



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;



"What I like is the fact Alaska's List doesn't allow discussion posts, which don't have anything at all to do with buying and selling stuff."



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;



"We sold our jeep off your list. You guys are awesome. Thanks"



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;



"Thanks... what you are doing here is wonderful. I hope it continues, grows even larger, and replaces craigslist. Good Job!"



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;



"First, thanks for kicking Craigsbutt! I love the local service. I sold my 20hp Johnson this weekend... Thanks again"



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;



"I very much appreciate your service, I am delighted that Alaska has it's own list now."



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;



"You have a great site! Thanks for being such a great alternative to Craigslist!"



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;



"Thanks... You guys are great. I have been telling everybody about your web site.  It is so much easier to surf."



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;



"Keep fighting the good fight.   I check this site almost daily and am pleased to note the growth you

are experiencing.  The need for your site is real and I am pleased to have an Alaska-relevant

alternative to that californicated Craigslist!"



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;



"I like your logo a lot better than Craigslist, I hate that stupid peace sign for a multitude of reasons."



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;



"I like the fact that you have the free part and a pay for placement section. I think that's great, if you can afford to advertise get yourself in the front. I've already told a few people."



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;



"Thank God and YOU for Alaska's List! My posting has already been flagged and is probably going to be pulled from Craig'slist!... so I decided to post with you... That was a wise choice on my part *pats myself on back* Again, thank you so much for giving Alaskan's an alternative to Craig'slist!"



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;



"Love your website, it beats the newspaper thats for sure."



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;



"I LOVE alaskaslist. The layout is so clean and easy to use."



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;



"Thanks for offering this service to our great state for an outstanding price... FREE!"



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;



"Just found your site... having been disappointed with craigslist for some time now... it's great to have a good alternative!"



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;



"Thanks for all you do.  Again, I love the web site."



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;



"Thanks for all your efforts. It's not un noticed."



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;



"Thanks so much. Not only is your site a refreshing change from all of the drama on CriagsList, but you're a total rockstar!"



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;



"The website is wonderful and keep up the good job!"



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;



"I REALLY like what you have done. A few examples I think you have a huge advantage on is the fact you allow pictures to be blown up to the size that was actually posted. I also like where a link can be inserted and a phone number slot is available."



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;



"I posted a few boats on your website. In less than 24 hours we have a deposit on one of our boats. It was your site that the lead came through. My feedback to you is THANK YOU. You did a great job and I HIGHLY ENCOURAGE you to start one for each state. I think you have something here that should be shared with everyone."



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;



"You guys have a great thing going. Let me know if I can be of help at all."



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;



"I just today was referred to your site and man am I impressed. I really appreciate you putting it together. It's nice to be able to go about my business without wading through the swamp of idiots that Craigslist has. Thanks again!"



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;



"First off your website is wonderful! Everybody is talking about it. I get replys within minutes of posting an ad. So thank you so much for what you have created. Second thing is can you delete every ad I have created. Your site is so good that I get calls after it has sold. Thanks"



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;



"I just sold one of the sets of tires.  Wow I love this website."



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;



"We sold our Argo yesterday from your site. Thank you very much."



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;



"I love your website and tell everyone I know about it. Your website WORKS. My phone won't stop ringing! Thank you."



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;



"Thank you for providing this service. It helped me sell my 1999 Suburban LS"



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;



"I was so excited to learn of this sight... I've totally had it with Craigslist. So, just wanted to say thank you... Alaskan's need this sight badly!"



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;



"GREAT website, I love the seperatation of your trailers... so much less work to find what you are

looking for.. GREAT job and thanks..."



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;



"I like your website. Will use it when ever possible. Its Alaska! Thxs"



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;



"Mr. Baker, What a supurb alternative... I too get very frustrated at Craigslist. I'm glad you took the initiative to create something positive for Alaska. We needed a change."



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;



"Just wanted to say thank you for doing something I think we've all been looking for here in AK. Craigslist rules are so California!"



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;



"Thanks for starting this sight. I didnt know until some one told me about it. There is a lot of bs going on at craigs sight. More arguements there to. Keep it up."





&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;



"I sold all three of my pups in one day, wow! The featured ads are amazing. Thanks!!"



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;



"Thanks for providing this site as an alternative to Craigslist.  I love the concept and hope you continue with great success."



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;



"Great job! Thanks for your help. Selling your house on your own is a big job. I needed that second set of eyes... Love the site and you are great in the customer service business."



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;



"Thanks for all you do on this site. We all do really appreciate it... This is a great site."



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;



"Great service, I like the look too.  Much better than CL."



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;



"Wow - what service! Thanks for providing personal service and a great site."



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;



"I've sent your URL to a few of my friends and family too who used Craig's list.  Told them this was a much better site. Read the article in the paper when it came out about your site and saved it. Now...I've tried it and I like it."



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;



By the way, Alaskaslist is a great site... been on Craig's list for years, and what a dirty, ugly site to do business on. Yours is so refreshing, and easy to navigate and post.  Easy to read all posts.



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;



"Your site is a wonderful thing after having to deal with Craigslist (he had good intentions, it was the users that messed it up). I hope Alaskaslist continues to grow!"



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;



I just sold an item that I posted yesterday. Thank you, great job on the web site.



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;



"Very impressive website you have there, and its very user friendly."



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;



"Awesome site!! No garbage/junk, REAL buyers, etc. I have two ads on your site... Sold my guns in only hours, and had a great experience. Good advice to put a phone number in with my ad."



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;



"The site is GREAT! I much prefer it to craigslist."



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;



"Thanks. Item sold.  I think maybe you have found a hot item for Alaska. Have talked with several people that have used the listing with success. Again, thanks for getting it going."



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;



"Thank you for your service. I had several people contact me in regards to my add on your website."



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;



"These items we posted have sold... Thanks so much for providing us a great resource."



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;



"Thanks for your services.  We have sold this truck and we appreciate your site, as it worked well for us. Thanks again."



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;



"Thank you for your help posting. Alaskaslist worked out great! The couch just sold! Will definitely be back to use this site more often. We'll see you next time. Thanks!"





&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;



"I also wanted to say how much I'm enjoying this website. It's very effective and MUCH cleaner than Craigslist... I'm hooked. Keep up the good work!"



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;



"This is my first time using Alaskaslist.com...and wasn't sure how it all worked. I'm very grateful for your website and like how user friendly it is (Much better than CL). Thanks so much!"



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;



"Hey thanks for the place to list our stuff. Keep up the good work."



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;



"Thanks for the opportunity to post my ad on your site. It's amazing what good service you provide, and how fast Alaska's list got popular - It's been my home page for awhile now. I appreciate the generosity!"



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;



"Thanks, this is an excellent idea, just need to get people used to looking for you. I'll do my share to spread the word. Keep up the good work! Alaskaslist is the best!"



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;





"I really LOVE alaskas list. Thanks for spearheading a flag free environment for us farming alaskans!"



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;



"I want to thank you for helping me sell my motor coach. The unit has been sold, and the response from

the ad with your group was twice the response from Craig's List and Big Boyz Toyz combined. Thanks for a wonderful service."



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;



"I too have been very frustrated by Craigslist flaggers... I was often left scratching my head wondering what in my ad could possibly deem a flagging.  It will be refreshing if Alaskaslist becomes as or more popular than Craigslist for local commerce and trade.  I will do my part to spread the word."



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;



"First and foremost I'd like to say THANK YOU for your contribution. We have needed a GOOD local sales

site in Alaska for a long time. Several have tried. You've done it! Thanks again. I placed my 1st ad

last Friday and had a HUGE success. I can't believe how soon the response started (10 minutes!!!) and

how many called! I was sold out by Sunday!"



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;



"I am impressed. You have a great thing going with your site. I can not stand CL at all. I feel like cattle on that site, and the flagging thing is way out of control. Well, keep up the good work."



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;



"We appreciate your site very much. We're selling things at Alaskaslist all the time now, and it's SO much better than Fee-bay and Flaggerslist. Best wishes from our family to yours."



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;



"Love Alaska's List! Thanks very much, we appreciate it and we're strong users!"



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;



"Thank you for your site. I sold my property through your alaskaslist.com."



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;



"I just discovered your site... Thank you VERY MUCH for a much needed breath of sanity. I have had a number of postings there flagged for no apparent reason... I wish you all the best in your endeavor and sure hope that Alaska's List thrives! I can assure you that I will do my best to make sure it does."



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;



"Kudos to you and your classifieds website!!! I like what you are doing because I too think Craigslist if full of crap. I wish you the best. Keep up the good work!"



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;



"Thank you.  You guys are awesome!!  I LOVE LOVE LOVE Alaskaslist!!"



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;



"Thank you alaskaslist for the wonderful service you provide to our community!"



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;



"Thank you for starting ALASKASLIST. You have helped me sell several articles already with absolutely no hassle."



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;



"Just wanted to send a big THANK YOU to you for giving all of us such a great site. I used to look at CL several times per day but I only check out here now. I have 2 featured ads with you and have recieved lots of inquiries from them."



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;



"WOW, what a refreshing business you have... I am going to tell everyone i know about this this Alaskaslist... impressed and appreciating you."



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;



"Nice website - it's good to have an alternative to CraigsList - have had problems listing there too - it's just too big for it's own good..."



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;



"Just the fact that they have guns alone makes Alaskaslist a better site by a large margin!! But you know, I also like that I only have to post my ad once there, whereas I would have to post my ad over and over again every 10 minutes at Craigslist because some idiot, who has never met me, is flagging my ad. I have no doubt that Alaskaslist will continue to grow with real advertisements, while Craigslist will always be full of BS discussions, flaggers, and a number of other things that makes Craigslist a waste of my time."



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;



"Thanks! I will use your sight from now on. I have had some run ins with those who have nothing better to do than remove postings that they don't like from CL and am glad that there is now an alternative! Keep it up and maybe the big boys will have to take notice of what those hateful people are doing on their web sites!"

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;



"I have been posting ads at Alaskaslist since you started the site and I sold everything that I posted within a week. I had those same postings on CL and they got flagged right away. Alaskaslist is the way to go. I have found my new list."

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;



"Just wanted to let you know you've done an awesome job with this website!  The flaggers have started attacking our programs and almost anything having to do with 4-H and animals.  Your site is like a breath of fresh air."



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;



"There is no denying that some people using Craigslist take the enforcement of posting rules a little too seriously. I attribute that behavior to the "rent-a-cop syndrome," which I did just make up to describe people with nothing better to do that are given some perceived authority, and voila, they have a reason for living after all. I hope Alaskaslist kicks Craigsbutt!"



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;



"Good on you, Mr. Baker! I found it very frustrating that animal litters were prohibited sales on craigslist.com and the newspaper had very little in terms of purebred dogs. Now I know where to seek my Boston Terrier pup!"



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;



"Good luck man! I love small ALASKAN business."



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;



"WooHoo Alaskalist.com! Craigslist is full of wimpy whiners!!"



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;



"Anything related to PETS is going to get flagged on Craigslist... You can thank the PETA fanatics for that... Thanks for making a site where animal sellers don't have to put up with that crap."



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;



"This site is a great idea. Craigslist is a haven for people with their own agenda, where they want to control other people's lives. There is no denial about it. I've seen it. They flag ads that are completely appropriate, yet allow pictures and comments that are not. you can even pick up prostitutes on craigslist. How appropriate is that?"



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;



"On craigslist you can't sell guns, but you can buy a lady of the night. Yep, that make sense. At alaskaslist, you CAN sell guns, but you CAN'T buy a lady of the night. Way to go!"



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;



"Nice, I added your site to my favorites. Thanks."



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;



"Nice! Thats the good ol' Alaskan spirit! Craigslist is a mess with a terrible user interface that gives too much power to the self-righteous."



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;



"There may be too many people with too much time on their hands when they spend all day reading craigs list so they can be an irritant and flag postings just because they can! Good Luck!"





&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;



"I just want to say I get frustrated looking at Craig's list . I think it's just a poorly put together website. Too much stuff that I think just doesn't pertain to buying and selling. Thank you."



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;



"I love your list and appreciate your hard work making a family friendly list for us Alaskans. Keep up the great work!"



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;



"Thanks for the great website, I hope you really kick craigslist's butt... I, like you, am tired of the flaggers on craigslist, these people are on a power trip and craigslist does not care! Your site has REAL possibilities, I wish You well!"

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;



"I sold my machine off Alaskaslist today. Also, I found you by the article in the ADN and love ya.  I can't stand cragislist and will be speading the word about you. Thanks for helping me sell my sled."



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;



"I think Alaskaslist is great! I think people are starting to see what a great site you started! Keep up the good work."



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;



"I just wanted to say thanks for the new web site I was  getting tired of craigslist also. Thanks again."



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;



"Because of your Web site I was able to sell my firearms right away. I will be selling more as I am downsizing my collection. Keep up the good work."



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;



"Thank you very much. I LOVE your list. My husband has been wanting something like this forever!  Excellent job."



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;



"You do have a great thing going alaskas list is what we needed for a long time."



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;



"VERY impressed with your site and your speedy e-mail replies! Thank you for all you are doing! You are awesome!! I will tell everyone about your website!"



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;



"I have used Craigslist alot in the past, but your site is so much cleaner and user-friendly; and Alaska grown! What a great thing contribution to us Alaskan's - thank you so much! I wish you the best and will pass this site on to everyone I know who used craigslist. You'll definately see me using your site regularly!"





&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;



"I didn't realize that your site has only been operational for such a short time.  A friend of mine told me of Alaskaslist and I thought I was behind the times.  Your site has brought attention to my business and I thank you.  I read the inspiring story on ADN.com and found it very compelling.  I wish you the best of luck and maybe, just maybe one day you will be as big as Craigslist. I would hope anyways. Take care and thank you for such a wonderful new inspiring site."



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;



"This is a much more usable site than Craig's List. Alaska needed something like this. Thank you for creating Alaskaslist.com!!!"





&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;



"This site has an outstanding layout, easy to read and navigate.  I haven't purchased, or sold, anything yet, but I have several items to be sold this summer and maybe next fall.  Thanks for creating such a great site for us!"



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;



"I want to thank you for letting me look for puppies and cats on alaskaslist.com without having to read the horrible stories and fighting you see on the animal sites of craigslist. Thanks Again."

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;



"&lt;!-- I used to live in Alaska and I don't really miss it.  Now with this great way to buy and sell anything, I miss being able to participate in that. --&gt;You are doing a great job and will service so many wonderful Alaskans. Keep up the good work!  And with you staying in control I believe it will be a good work!! Congratulations!!"



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;



"I read about your site on a Drudgereport.com link and applaud your efforts.  I too, am weary of the constant flagging and hateful people on Craigslist.  I'm glad to see there's some American spirit of free market capitalism still kicking here in Alaska!!  Best wishes and good luck with your site."



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;



"I love it that you have done this! Nice to have a site for Alaska and not just craigslist."



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;



"I love having more alternatives to do things. I dislike all of the politics and garbage. You have done a good thing here!"



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;



"Okay! I already thought this was awesome, but your proving to be beyond that! Fast reply, I love the site, user friendly (for a dummy like me). Your guys are too good! My dad is hanging up right now to call a craig user to tell them about alaskaslist. You have a great thing going. Thank you!"



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;



"I love Alaska's List. I had my truck posted for sale on Craigslist for six months and only got about 6 people scheduling test drives and then never showing up. I posted on Alaska's List and one week later my truck was gone. It is so nice to be able to post an ad and it get read by serious people instead of scammers. Thank You Alaska's List."



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;



"Hey just wanted to say I love your site. I use the gun and hunting section all the time... Keep up the good work."



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;



"Your format is far superior to Craigslist, easier to read, and far more organized. I hope your site is sucessful in attracting local peddlers.  Craigslist can keep the folks looking for "threesomes tonight", and all that type of stuff."



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;



"Wow, THANK YOU for taking the bull by the horns. Craigslist flaggers have been the bane of my posting existence in trying to sell things. A snow plow kept getting flagged out of auto sales because they wanted it in garden tools, for crying out loud. I've wondered how they could get away with so much flagging, what the criteria was, and who - exactly - had the authority to decide what got flagged, but there never seemed to be any rhyme or reason. My ads were legitimate, sold nothing illegal, and seemed perfectly sensible but somehow I would always be deemed inappropriate. Aaargggh!! So, good job for creating something we Alaskans can use the way we want. Alaskaslist may be the best thing since smoked salmon..."



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;



"This is a much more usable site than Craig's List. Alaska needed something like this. Thank you for creating Alaskaslist.com!"



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;



"This site has an outstanding layout, easy to read and navigate. Thanks for creating such a great site for us!"

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;



"I have made several sales and a purchase or two on this wonderful new Alaskaslist. Thanks."

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;



"I'm glad someone is finally providing a conservative alternative to Craigslist... &lt;!-- Most people are strangely oblivious to this fact, but Craigslist contains some of the most explicit pornography one could possibly find anywhere on the Internet..., especially in their Men Seeking Men category, as well as unbelievably explicit chat in their Queer Chat rooms."



If you asked most people if they would be willing to advertise in a

completely unedited Web site, which contained explicit, pornographic images (that children can easily get to), most would say, "no way." Yet, that is exactly what folks are doing when they advertise on Craigslist. I call it "Satan's List," because only the Devil himself could make otherwise good people put on their blinders to such evil. --&gt; Thanks Alaska's List. Your website is just what we needed here in the Greatland."



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;



"I sold my Browning 9mm off of Alaskaslist in less than 12 hours. This ad got twice as many responses as any other medium I tried. Thanks."



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;



"YOU ARE LIKE WAY TOO COOL! I admire you alot for being able to do all of these wonderful deeds for our Alaskan communities... Who would have known you were capable of so much. It is nice to see that some of us can still make a difference. THANK YOU... THANK YOU... THANK YOU!!!!! I love Alaskaslist by the way!"



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;



"Thanks, what a fantastic site. Godbless thanks."



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;



"Thank you for starting this site.  You are certainly a breath of fresh air and I know you will have great success, because the force is with you."



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;



"I am glad you took the initiative and started a list that is monitored. It is a needed link in networking here in Alaska. Alaskaslist offers clean and hassle free networking."



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;



"I placed an ad on your website for a puppy I found a home for, thanks to you guys! Those blessings are sweetest that are won with prayers and with thanks."



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;



"Appreciate y'all listing guns on this site, which is great with or without guns. (better with!)"



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;



"I fought the CL flagging police long and hard, tried reasoning, re-posting constantly, and was attacked from every side.  I even got voice mails at my home, nasty ones, from these horrible flagging police.  So I am very sincere in my appreciation of your wonderful place I can post without fear."



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;



"Can't thank you enough for featuring my small business.  I lost almost 25% of my business when I could no longer post on CL.  I can't tell you how happy I am that someone like you has taken this initiative and created this incredible site for Alaskans."



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;



"Thank you Alaskaslist for supporting our 2nd Amendment rights. They won't even let me advertise a gun scope at Craigslist. It only took me a day to sell my gun off your site. I guess I didn't ask enough for it. :) Keep up the good work. I'm going to tell all my buddies about Alaskaslist."



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;



"Just wanted to say, "Good Job." Thanks for taking the time to put this together. Keep up the good work. I will be looking forward to your improvements. I will most definitely spread the word about your site."



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;



"I have been considering building an Alaskan, buy sell &amp;amp; trade site, but I'm way to busy to to do it. Thanks for doing all the work for me. I think this site is AWESOME!!! Keep up the good work."



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;



"Hey!! Love your new site! Keep up the good work - we need something local for a change.

Thanks"



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;



"Nice job on your classified ad list. It looks great. I'm working on one myself, but I like your layout better. Good luck."



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;



"Way to go Team Alaska! Having experienced such contempt myself on CL, I applaud your efforts. We in this state have a different and well grounded mindset (for the most part) and it is sad that such rabble can accost us like they do at Craigslist. Kudos to the entire team @ Alaskaslist for their marvelous fortitude and dedicated upholding of the Alaskan spirit. AK4ever. YO!"



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;



"CL has become intolerable, thank you for offering an alternative website.  I see

most of the reputable horse people are here already.  Now that I found it, will

frequent your site instead of CL."



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;



"Thank you so much Alaskaslist. I am again selling and buying as I once did on Brand

X. Thank You for helping Alaskans!"



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;



"Just wanted to say I am glad you guys started this site. Thanks for taking time out

to put it all together. And thank goodness that there is no more flagging! You rock!"



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;



"Thanks a bunch! I still look at Craigslist from time to time and its amazing the BS thats going on. You guys definitely have my vote. We sold 2 pups and 1 snake from your site so far. We will support you guys anyway we can. I know you are staying busy with the site, with vast improvements since the beginning. Keep up the hard work."



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;



"Thanks for your courage and hard work to provide this great site. You are the freedom loving Alaskan that we've been waiting for. Again, Thanks for your site and attitude. I hope that you have excellent results and are prosperous. PROUD TO BE ALASKAN"



&lt;i&gt;"Thank you so much, whoever started this site, because I can now post my ad, or post for a found kitty who needs a home, or a stray dog, or whatever, and I know I won't get flagged, plus the post is seen by so many people now. Every time I check in it's bigger."



&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;



"I've noticed that I no longer check in with Craigslist first. Now I go to Alaskaslist first, then glance in to the chaos at CL, and just pop back over to the order and relaxed feeling at Alaskaslist. I am part of the ground floor of a potentially huge site. I'm telling everyone about this site and getting everyone, all my clients and friends, to hop on and check it out."



&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;



"I've sent out so many emails. If you're sick of the silliness on CL then tell your friends about this other Alaskan specific site. Send out emails to everyone on your list. Let's support this site and take the 'mission from god' away from the flagging Nazis and self-appointed police on CL."



&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font id="text-big"&gt;&lt;i&gt;



"I used that site last week to rehome a dog. It worked wonderfully! I love Craigslist for the funnies, but when I want to look at some real ads I go to Alaskaslist."



&lt;/i&gt;
