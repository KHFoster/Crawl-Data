&lt;div id="title-big"&gt;Introduction&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="four"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id="words-big"&gt;Alaska's List&lt;div id="cr_reg"&gt;®&lt;/div&gt; is a huge online service, featuring classified ads placed by people throughout the Greatland and beyond. Clean, well-organized, and professionally moderated, Alaska's List&lt;div id="cr_reg"&gt;®&lt;/div&gt; is classifieds done right!&lt;div id="cr_reg"&gt;™&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div align="left" style="margin-left:30px"&gt;&lt;img src="/images/vertical_logo.jpg" width="524" height="370" border="0" alt="Alaska's List"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div style="display:block;height:25px;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;div id="FAQ"&gt;



&lt;div id="title-big"&gt;Frequently Asked Questions&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;div class="four"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;













&lt;div id="title-small"&gt;Q. How do I sign up to use your service?&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;div class="four"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;div id="words-big"&gt;There's no need to sign-up for anything to use our service.&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;div class="twelve"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;











&lt;div id="title-small"&gt;Q. How do I post an ad?&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;div class="four"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;div id="words-big"&gt;All you have to do to post an ad is look at the top, left-hand corner of our home page. There, you'll see a large, blue button with the words, "Post Your Ad" on it. Click on that button, and follow the simple instructions that follow. You'll find that it's really easy to post your ad. &lt;a href="/selectstate.php"&gt;Give it a try&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;!--

&lt;div class=eight&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;div id=words-big&gt;You can also post your Featured Ad by telephone. Just call &lt;b&gt;(907) 854-0910&lt;/b&gt; between 8:00 AM - 6:00 PM (AKDT), and a real human being will answer the phone to assist you -- just the like the good ol' days.&lt;/div&gt;

--&gt;







&lt;div class="twelve"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;div id="Manage"&gt;



&lt;a name="Manage"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;



&lt;div id="title-small"&gt;Q. How do I manage my ad after it is posted?&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;div class="four"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;div id="words-big"&gt;Immediately after you post your ad, our system will automatically send you an Ad Management E-mail. The subject line of that message will appear as "&lt;font style="color:#008000;"&gt;EDIT/MANAGE: Your Ad Title&lt;/font&gt;" in the inbox of your e-mail program. In that e-mail, you'll find a special link you can click on in order to access your Ad Management Page, where you can edit or delete your ad, check its publication status, or manage any picture attachments you may have.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;!--

&lt;div class=eight&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;div id=words-big&gt;If you're a Featured Advertiser, we're always ready to assist you with your ad by phone whenever you require that level of service.&lt;/div&gt;

--&gt;



&lt;/div&gt;



















&lt;div class="twelve"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;div id="Expire"&gt;



&lt;a name="Expire"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;



&lt;div id="title-small"&gt;Q. When does my ad expire?&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;div class="four"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;div id="words-big"&gt;Your ad expires whenever you delete it. When you post your ad, you agree that it will be your personal responsibility to delete your ad when you decide you no longer need it. Until you do that, or until we have reason to believe otherwise (e.g. animal ads, moving ads, etc.), we will assume that your item is still available, and that's why you haven't deleted it.&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;div class="eight"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;div id="words-big"&gt;We don't think advertising on the Internet should be like combat fishing. We understand that some things sell right away, and that some things take longer. Either way, you'll only have to post your ad at Alaska's List once, and we'll take care of maintaining it on our system, and making sure everybody follows the rules, until you decide you don't need it anymore, and delete it.&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;div class="eight"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;div id="words-big"&gt;In our opinion, posting your ad at Alaska's List is the most straightforward and hassle-free way to advertise something on the Internet.&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;/div&gt;



















&lt;div class="twelve"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;div id="Delete"&gt;



&lt;a name="Delete"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;



&lt;div id="title-small"&gt;Q. How do I delete my ad?&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;div class="four"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;div id="words-big"&gt;To delete your ad, simply click on the special edit link contained in the Ad Management E-mail that we sent to you when you first placed your ad. When you click on that link, you will be taken to the Ad Management Page for that ad. At the top of your Ad Management Page, you'll find a "Delete Ad" link, which you may click in order to delete your ad.&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;div class="eight"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;div id="words-big"&gt;If you don't have your Ad Management E-mail, &lt;a href="mailto:webmaster@alaskaslist.com?subject=Deletion Request"&gt;send us a Deletion Request&lt;/a&gt; from the same e-mail address you used to place your ad. For security reasons, we can only process Deletion Requests that are sent to us from the e-mail address of record for that ad. If you're a Featured Advertiser, you can always call or text us from the phone number associated with your ad, and we will delete your ad for you.&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;/div&gt;











&lt;div class="twelve"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;div id="Resend"&gt;



&lt;a name="Resend"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;



&lt;div id="title-small"&gt;Q. What if I lose my Ad Management E-mail?&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;div class="four"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;





&lt;div id="words-big"&gt;If you ever lose your Ad Management E-mail, or if it fails to arrive, all you have to do is &lt;a href="mailto:webmaster@alaskaslist.com?subject=Resend Request"&gt;request a new one&lt;/a&gt;, and we'll resend it to you right away. When contacting us for this purpose, be sure to do so using the e-mail address that you used when you first placed your ad because, for security reasons, that's the only e-mail address we can send it to. If you have more than one ad, please provide us with your ad number.&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;/div&gt;













&lt;div class="twelve"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;div id="Failures"&gt;



&lt;a name="Failures"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;



&lt;div id="title-small"&gt;Q. Why didn't I receive my Ad Management E-mail?&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;div class="four"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;div id="words-big"&gt;Our system will immediately send you an Ad Management E-mail when you post your ad. While this is both an automated and failsafe process, your Ad Management E-mail may have been mistakenly moved to your Trash or Junk folder by your e-mail service's Anti-SPAM system. Many E-mail Service Providers use unsophisticated Spam detection services which will often misclassify and misroute e-mails that contain the word "ad" in the body of the message, as ours do. So, be certain to check the other folders of your e-mail program. You will likely find it there.&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;div class="eight"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;div id="words-big"&gt;There's also the possibility that you misspelled your e-mail address when you placed your ad, in which case, your Ad Management E-mail will usually be returned to us as "undeliverable." When this happens, we suspend the ad since it would be impossible for you to manage it without an Ad Management E-mail. This is actually quite common. About one out of every 100 users misspell their e-mail address when submitting their ad.&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;div class="eight"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;div id="words-big"&gt;If you didn't receive your Ad Management E-mail after you posted your ad, you should &lt;a href="mailto:webmaster@alaskaslist.com?subject=Resend Request"&gt;contact us&lt;/a&gt; as soon as possible, so we can get the problem straightened out for you.&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;/div&gt;







&lt;!--

&lt;div class=twelve&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;div id="Counters"&gt;



&lt;a name="Counters"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;



&lt;div id=title-small&gt;Q. Why did you take out the hit counters?&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;div class=four&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;div id=words-big&gt;The primary reason we have decided to do away with the hit counters is that they are not really a useful as a means of recording how many people viewed an ad. They only counted the number of times someone actually clicked through to an ad, not how many times they read it, or were exposed to it, while they were visiting our category list or viewing search results. Remember, we do provide an extensive 327 character preview of every Featured Ad, and a 108 character preview of every Free Ad.&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;div class=eight&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;div id=words-big&gt;Ultimately, what we were ending-up with was a situation where thousands of visitors were reading ads (many in their entirety), but the hit counters weren't able to make a meaningful record of it.&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;div class=eight&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;div id=words-big&gt;Moreover, with our site's new image preview feature, where readers can see the best image from our Featured Ads when they move their mouse over the ad title, people are pretty much be able to read an ad, in most of its glory, without ever having to actually click through to the ad page at all (unless they are genuinely interested), which is a system that we feel works best for everyone, and readers really like it, because it saves them time.&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;/div&gt;





The primary reason we have decided to do away with the hit counters is that they are not really a useful as a means of recording how many people viewed your ad. They only counted the number of times someone actually clicked through to your ad (a "Page View"), not how many times they actually read it, or were exposed to it, while viewing it (often in its entirety) in the category List or Search Result views. We do provide an extensive 327 character preview of every Featured Ad, and a 108 character preview of every Free Ad.



Ultimately, what we were ending-up with was a situation where thousands of visitors were reading ads (what's called a "hit" in advertising), but the hit counters weren't able to make a meaningful record of it.



Hit counters became even more meaningless when we introduced our site's new Image Preview feature. Now, readers can now see the best image from a Featured Ad when they move their mouse over its title, which makes hit counters on a Featured Ad page almost completely irrelevant since readers can now pretty much read and view any Featured Ad they want, in most of its glory, without ever having to actually click through to that ad page at all (unless they're genuinely interested).



We think this new system works best for everyone, and we're going to stick with it. readers seem to like it, and so do we.

--&gt;



&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;div style="display:block;height:25px;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;









&lt;div id="Privacy"&gt;



&lt;div id="title-big"&gt;Privacy Policy&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;div class="four"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;div id="words-big"&gt;Alaska's List is committed to safeguarding your privacy online. Please read the following policy to understand how your information will be treated as you make use of Alaska's List. This policy may change from time to time, so please check back periodically.&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;div class="twelve"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;div id="title-small"&gt;Information Collection&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;div class="four"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;div id="words-big"&gt;When you post your ad, Alaska's List will ask you for your e-mail address and your telephone number only. We will not ask you for personally-identifiable information such as your name or your address.&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;div class="twelve"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;div id="title-small"&gt;Information Storage&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;div class="four"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;div id="words-big"&gt;Once you delete your ad using the facilities provided for doing so on your Ad Management Page, all information associated with that ad is permanently deleted from our database, at which time it will no longer be available from Alaska's List for any purpose.&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;div class="twelve"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;div id="title-small"&gt;Information Sharing&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;div class="four"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;div id="words-big"&gt;Alaska's List will not sell, or otherwise disclose, any information about you to any third party except when we have your expressed permission to do so, or under special circumstances, such as when we are served with a Lawful Court Order compelling Alaska's List to do so; or when we have reason to believe that disclosing this information is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who may be violating our Terms of Use Agreement or who may be causing injury to, or interference with (either intentionally or unintentionally), the rights or property of Alaska's List, the users of this Web site, or anyone else.&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;div class="eight"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;div id="words-big"&gt;Because no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, Alaska's List cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us over the Internet, and you do so at your own risk. However, once we receive any information from you via our Web server, we agree to exercise due dilligence, and make our best effort to ensure the security of your information while it resides on our system.&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div style="border-style:dashed;border-width:1px;border-color:orange;background:#f5f5f5;padding:10px;padding-top:8px;text-align:left;border-radius:3px;margin-top:12px;margin-right:25px"&gt;

&lt;div id="words-big"&gt;If you're a Featured Advertiser, you can always email your pictures to us at &lt;a href="mailto:webmaster@alaskaslist.com"&gt;webmaster@alaskaslist.com&lt;/a&gt;, or text them to us at &lt;b&gt;(907) 854-0910&lt;/b&gt;. Whenever you do, we will take care of optimizing them, and uploading them to your ad, free of charge.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;div class="eight"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;div id="words-big"&gt;If you want to learn more about uploading images, we encourage you to read and utilize the help information provided below. We try to make the topic as uncomplicated and informative as possible.&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;div class="eight"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;div id="words-big" style="color:green"&gt;Here's a list of things to consider when uploading images...&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;div class="eight"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;div id="title-small"&gt;Blank Spaces Forbidden&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;div class="four"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;div id="words-big"&gt;Images that have blank spaces in the file name will fail to upload. Unix-based Web servers like ours, which are the most common type of Web servers used on the Internet, do not support blank spaces in the file name. So, take a close look at your image's file name. If it has a file name that contains any blank spaces within it (e.g. "&lt;font style="font-family:courier;color:red;font-size:12pt;font-weight:bold;"&gt;file name.jpg&lt;/font&gt;"), it will not upload successfuly. To correct the problem, simply rename your file, replacing the blank spaces with an underscore or a hyphen (e.g. "&lt;font style="font-family:courier;color:green;font-size:12pt;font-weight:bold;"&gt;file_name.jpg&lt;/font&gt;").&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;div class="twelve"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;div id="title-small"&gt;File Type Matters&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;div class="four"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;div id="words-big"&gt;Our sytem is designed to permit the upload of open source image formats such as .JPG, .GIF, and .PNG files. Only files that have one of these extensions will upload successfully. Take a close look at your image's file name. If it doesn't have one of these file extensions (e.g. if it just says, "&lt;font style="font-family:courier;color:red;font-size:12pt;font-weight:bold;"&gt;filename&lt;/font&gt;") it will not upload successfuly. It must have a file type designation after the file name (e.g. "&lt;font style="font-family:courier;color:green;font-size:12pt;font-weight:bold;"&gt;filename.jpg&lt;/font&gt;") in order to upload. File type designations tell computers what type of file is to be uploaded, and how to treat the file. Because image files are binary files, they can be used to harbor viruses, which is why we have to be careful about what types of image files we allow to be uploaded to our server.&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;div class="twelve"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;div id="title-small"&gt;Image Size Matters&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;div class="four"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;div id="words-big"&gt;The maximum image size we recommend is 1024 x 768 pixels. If your image is bigger than this, resize your images with an image editor, or set your camera to take lower resolution photos. Many people set their cameras to take the highest resolution photos possible, which can produce pictures as large as 3463 pixels x 1774 pixels, or even larger. Images that large just aren't useful on the Web, because of their large file size, and are likely to fail upon upload.&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;div class="twelve"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;div id="title-small"&gt;File Size Matters&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;div class="four"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;div id="words-big"&gt;The combined file size of all of your images must be under 8 Megabytes. Since we display your image to the user with only minimal compression, it's a good idea to upload pictures of a "reasonable" size. Uploading extremely large images will only make your images load really slow for users who are on dial-up and slow DSL connections. Generally speaking, if you resize your images to something no larger than 1024 x 768 pixels, it will solve all image size and file size problems.&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;div class="twelve"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;div id="title-small"&gt;Upload Speed Matters&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;div class="four"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;div id="words-big"&gt;While our server has practically unlimited resources and bandwidth, we have found that most user's have very little upload speed allocated to them by their Internet Service Provider for uploading purposes. In fact, most ISPs sell high speed Internet connections to their customers, but don't tell them that they will only be provided a fraction of that "high speed" connection for uploading purposes. Actually, the "high speeds" ISPs advertise only apply to downloading, and not to uploading, which is why it takes so long to upload photos directly to Web sites such as ours. To demonstrate this point, feel free to compare your download vs. upload speed by using &lt;a target="_blank" title="GCI Speed Test Tool ..." href="http://speedtest.gci.com"&gt;GCI's Online Speed Test Tool&lt;/a&gt;. You'll be shocked by the difference.&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;div class="eight"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;div id="words-big"&gt;That said. If you try to upload an enormous file, and don't have much upload speed, our server will probably time-out on you, because, for security reasons, it will only allow itself to be tied up, waiting on a single user for a period of 5 minutes in order to complete an upload.&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;div class="eight"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;div id="words-big"&gt;In our view, any file that would take longer than 5 minutes to upload is too big to be uploaded in the first place, and should be resized beforehand, using either a graphics editor, the software that came with your camera, or any one of the many online &lt;a href="https://www.google.com/webhp?#q=photo+resizer" target="_blank"&gt;photo resizing services&lt;/a&gt; that are available to you.&lt;/div&gt;







&lt;/div&gt;





&lt;div style="display:block;height:25px;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;





&lt;div id="Search"&gt;



&lt;div id="title-big"&gt;Search Documentation&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;div class="four"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;div id="words-big"&gt;Our search engine is what is referred to as an "Exact Substring Search." What this means is that rather than looking for loose or "fuzzy" matches to what you search for, our search engine will only return ads which contain exact matches to the text you enter into the search box.&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;div class="twelve"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;div id="title-small"&gt;Search for Exact Words or Word Substrings&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;div class="four"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;div id="words-big"&gt;One of the most useful features of our search engine is that it will not only look for exact matches to words and groups of words that you submit, it will also look for parts of a word. For example, a search for "chev" will return ads which contain the words "chevy" or "chevrolet". Whereas, a search for the word "chevrolet" will not return any ads which contain the word "chevy".&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;div class="twelve"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;div id="title-small"&gt;Don't Use Search Operators&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;div class="four"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;div id="words-big"&gt;Boolean seach operators such as the following are not supported: &lt;font style="font-family:courier;color:red;font-size:12pt"&gt;+ - " | /&lt;/font&gt;, so any attempts to use these characters within your query will only lead to failed searches.&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;div class="twelve"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;div id="title-small"&gt;Simplify Your Searches&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;div class="four"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;div id="words-big"&gt;For the best results, simplify your searches as much as possible. Search for the most likely keyword (by itself) during your initial searches, and then construct more refined searches based on those results.&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;div class="twelve"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;div id="title-small"&gt;Use Upper or Lower Case Letters&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;div class="four"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;div id="words-big"&gt;Searches are case insensitive, which means that it doesn't matter if you type a word in all caps, or use all lowercase letters. It will not impact your search results.&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;/div&gt;





&lt;div style="display:block;height:25px;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



















&lt;div id="Terms"&gt;



&lt;div id="title-big"&gt;Terms of Use Agreement&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;div class="four"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;div id="words-big"&gt;Alaska's List strives to maintain a clean, well-organized Web site where folks can buy and sell things online in a professionally moderated environment. With that in mind, we welcome you to post any tangible thing or service you may have for sale, lease, or rent, provided that your ad does not contain anything illegal, profane, pornographic, libelous, or anything which might otherwise violate our Terms of Use Agreement.&lt;/div&gt;







&lt;div class="twelve"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;div id="title-small"&gt;Wanted Ads&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;div class="four"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;div id="words-big"&gt;With well over 25,000 visitors every day, Alaska's List couldn't possibly run unqualified ads describing what each of our users is looking for. Our site would quickly become unusable for readers. Therefore, wanted ads of any type are only accepted for publication as Featured Ads.&lt;/div&gt;





&lt;div class="twelve"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;





&lt;div id="title-small"&gt;Commercial Advertising&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;div class="four"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;div id="words-big"&gt;Subject to our discretion, advertisers who are using Alaska's List for, or in support of, commercial purposes are required to purchase one of our low-cost Featured Ads in order to advertise.&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;!--

&lt;div class=eight&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;div id=words-big&gt;Like any legitimate business, Alaska's List believes in Capitalism. In fact, our site is a celebration of Capitalism. Therefore we reject every idea of Communism, including the one which claims that everyone is entitled to everything free, and we do so for all of the same reasons anyone else engaged in commerce does; because it's antithetical to Capitalism, the idea that motivates people to sell goods or services, as opposed to giving them away for free.&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;div class=eight&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;div id=words-big&gt;Capitalism is based entirely upon the act of people exchanging goods and services for their mutual benefit. Without exchange, there can be no mutual benefit, no sharing of prosperity, which is necessary to lift all of society up.&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;div class=eight&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;div id=words-big&gt;Capitalism isn't about free, and Freedom isn't free either. You have to pay in order to make either one a reality.

&lt;/div&gt;





&lt;div id=words-big&gt;True Free Market Capitalism, not the predatory Monopoly Capitalism that you see so much of today, is the philosophy that the best economies are ones based upon the act of free people (and businesses) exchanging goods and services for their mutual benefit. Without that exchange, there can be no mutual benefit, no rising tide of prosperity to lift all of society up.&lt;/div&gt;



Besides, history proves that Communism doesn't work. It just lays around, waiting on someone else to feed it.

&lt;div class=eight&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;div id=words-big&gt;Why? Because giving charity to those who don't really need it is just as morally wrong, as it is for someone to accept charity when they don't really need it. It's also antithetical to Capitalism, which is the very basis of all commericial activity.&lt;/div&gt;



; because it's antithetical to the most basic principle of Capitalism itself

--&gt;



&lt;div class="twelve"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;







&lt;a name="Gun"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;



&lt;div id="title-small"&gt;Gun Section Sales&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;div class="four"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;div id="words-big"&gt;Because we support your God-given, Natural Rights to Free Speech, and to Keep and Bear Arms, which are guaranteed under the Constitution, we do permit firearm and firearm-related sales here at Alaska's List. However, we must require that you publish your telephone number in your Gun section ad, and rely on that as your sole means of initial contact with readers.&lt;/div&gt;







&lt;div class="twelve"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

















&lt;div id="title-small"&gt;Web Site Promotion&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;div class="four"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;div id="words-big"&gt;It has never been our intention to become an Internet search service. Alaska's List is a classifieds site, so naturally, we want folks who advertise here to provide enough compelling information in their ad to cause our readers to want to call or write to them, and say "Hey! I saw your ad on Alaska's List, and..." That's what it's all about; making that connection between the reader and the advertiser happen right here at Alaska's List, not somewhere else.&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;div class="eight"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;div id="words-big"&gt;This policy is essential, as it helps to ensure that the high value of our service doesn't go unrecognized.&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;div class="eight"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;div id="words-big"&gt;We do permit links to external sites in Featured Ads, provided they are owned and operated by the advertiser, but we don't permit links to third-party sites, or to sites which host, link to, or reference competing services. We also don't permit Web addresses to appear anywhere except at or near the bottom of an ad which contains at least 327 characters of information for the reader's consideration.&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;div class="twelve"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;











&lt;div id="Posting"&gt;

&lt;div id="title-small"&gt;Posting Frequency&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="four"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id="words-big"&gt;We don't believe advertising on the Internet should be like combat fishing, so pursuant to that belief, Alaska's List enforces a strict limit of one ad posting (per item) every 30 days for all unpaid advertisements. &lt;!-- After that, if you wish to move your ad to the top of the List, you will be able to do so any time whenever you buy Featured Ad Time for the ad using the facilities that we provide for doing so on your Ad Management Page. --&gt;This policy ensures that the value and benefit of our Featured Ads are not diminished.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;











&lt;div class="twelve"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;div id="title-small"&gt;General Stipulations&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id="Deletion"&gt;



&lt;div id="title-big"&gt;Deleting Your Ad is Easy&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;div class="four"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;div id="words-big"&gt;In order to delete your ad, simply click on the special edit link contained in the Ad Management E-mail that we sent to you when you first placed your ad. When you click on that link, you will be taken to the Ad Management Page for that ad. At the top of that page, there is a "&lt;span style="color:#cc0000&amp;quot;"&gt;Delete Ad&lt;/span&gt;" link, which you may click in order to delete your ad.&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;div class="eight"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;div id="words-big"&gt;You can also send us a &lt;a href="mailto:webmaster@alaskaslist.com?subject=Deletion Request"&gt;Deletion Request&lt;/a&gt; from the e-mail address you used to place your ad. We will quickly process any Deletion Request sent to us from the e-mail address of record for any ad. If you have more than one ad, be sure to provide us with the Ad Number of the ad you want to delete. That number appears at the top of every ad.&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;div class="eight"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;div id="words-big"&gt;If, for some reason, you no longer have lost your Ad Management E-mail, or don't have access to the e-mail account you used to post your ad, or you can't remember the e-mail address that you used to post the ad, no problem. We understand that sometimes happens. Just tell us as much in your Deletion Request. There's lots of ways to skin a moose.&lt;/div&gt;





&lt;/div&gt;





&lt;div style="display:block;height:25px;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;





&lt;div id="Payments"&gt;



&lt;div id="title-big"&gt;Making Payment&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;div class="four"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;div id="words-big"&gt;When you post your ad, you will be presented with a secure PayPal Button, which you will click on to make payment using any debit or credit card.&lt;div class="eight"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;PayPal membership is not required, and you won't be required to login there even if you are a member.&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;/div&gt;





&lt;div style="display:block;height:25px;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;





&lt;div id="Guns"&gt;



&lt;div id="title-big"&gt;Gun Section Policy&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;div class="four"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;div id="words-big"&gt;Because we support your God-given, Natural Rights to Free Speech, and to Keep and Bear Arms, which are guaranteed under the Constitution, we do permit firearm and firearm-related sales at Alaska's List. However, we must require that you publish your telephone phone number in your Gun section ad, and rely on that number as your sole means of contact with our readers. For everyone's safety, Gun Section ads are a "by telephone only" thing at Alaska's List.&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;/div&gt;





&lt;div style="display:block;height:25px;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;





&lt;div id="URLs"&gt;



&lt;div id="title-big"&gt;Web Site Promotion Policy&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;div class="four"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;div id="words-big"&gt;It has never been our intention to become an Internet search service. Alaska's List is a classifieds site, and so, quite naturally, we want advertisers to provide enough compelling information in their ad to cause our readers to want to call or write to them, and say "Hey! I saw your ad on Alaska's List, and..."&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;div class="eight"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;div id="words-big"&gt;That's what it's all about--making that connection between the buyer and the seller happen right here at Alaska's List rather than somewhere else. This policy is essential, as it helps to ensure that the high value of our service doesn't go unrecognized.&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;div class="eight"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;div id="words-big"&gt;While we do permit links to external sites in our Featured Ads, we do not permit links to third-party sites, or to sites which host, link to, or reference, competing services.&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;/div&gt;





&lt;div style="display:block;height:25px;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;





&lt;div id="Editing"&gt;



&lt;div id="title-big"&gt;Editing Privileges Disabled&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;div class="four"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;div id="words-big"&gt;Pursuant to our Terms of Use Agreement, editing privileges for this ad have been disabled by our site's Editorial Staff.&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;div class="eight"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;div id="words-big"&gt;The most common reason for this action is that it was found to contain prohibited content, or it was found to be set out in such a way, which violated our Terms of Use Agreement or Publication Policies, or all of the above.&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;div class="eight"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;div id="words-big"&gt;Whichever the case may be, editing functionality for this ad has been disabled in order to ensure that it will no longer require the attention of our site's Editorial Staff.&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;div class="eight"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;div id="words-big"&gt;While you may no longer be able to edit this ad, your ability to delete it whenever you wish to do so remains unaffected.&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;div class="eight"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;div id="words-big"&gt;Thank you for your understanding.&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;/div&gt;











&lt;div id="Rates"&gt;



&lt;div style="display:block;height:10px;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;





&lt;div class="four"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;div style="display:inline-block;white-space:nowrap;"&gt;&lt;div style="margin-top:0px;margin-left:8px;padding-bottom:2px;display:inline-block;position:relative;top:3px" id="newsmall"&gt;&lt;div id="android_b"&gt;&lt;b&gt;14 Days&lt;/b&gt;  &lt;i&gt;only&lt;/i&gt; &lt;b&gt;$3.49&lt;/b&gt; &lt;span style="color:#444;font-size:11px;position:relative;top:-2px" id="25"&gt;= 25¢/day&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;div style="display:inline-block;white-space:nowrap;"&gt;&lt;div style="margin:0px;margin-left:8px;padding-bottom:2px;display:inline-block;position:relative;top:3px" id="newsmall"&gt;&lt;div id="android_b"&gt;&lt;b&gt;30 Days&lt;/b&gt;  &lt;i&gt;only&lt;/i&gt; &lt;b&gt;$4.89&lt;/b&gt; &lt;span style="color:#444;font-size:11px;position:relative;top:-2px" id="16"&gt;= 16¢/day&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;div style="display:inline-block;white-space:nowrap;"&gt;&lt;div style="margin:0px;margin-left:8px;padding-bottom:2px;display:inline-block;position:relative;top:3px" id="newsmall"&gt;&lt;div id="android_b"&gt;&lt;b&gt;60 Days&lt;/b&gt;  &lt;i&gt;only&lt;/i&gt; &lt;b&gt;$7.89&lt;/b&gt; &lt;span style="color:#444;font-size:11px;position:relative;top:-2px" id="13"&gt;= 13¢/day&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;div style="display:inline-block;white-space:nowrap;"&gt;&lt;div style="margin:0px;margin-left:8px;padding-bottom:2px;display:inline-block;position:relative;top:3px" id="newsmall"&gt;&lt;div id="android_b"&gt;&lt;b&gt;90 Days&lt;/b&gt;  &lt;i&gt;only&lt;/i&gt; &lt;b&gt;$9.89&lt;/b&gt; &lt;span style="color:#008000;font-size:11px;position:relative;top:-2px" id="10"&gt;= 10¢/day&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;





&lt;/div&gt;







&lt;div id="FrontPage"&gt;



&lt;div style="display:block;height:10px;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;div id="title-big"&gt;Front Page Image Promotion&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;div class="four"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;div id="words-big"&gt;The front page is the busiest page at Alaska's List. Over 75% of all visitors come to Alaska's List using our front page as their starting point. So, it just makes a lot of sense that you would want to present what you're offering to those eyes. Many visitors may not be headed to your category, and seeing an your image there might be all that's necessary to pique their interest, and cause them to click through to your ad.&lt;/div&gt;





&lt;/div&gt;









&lt;div id="Sitewide"&gt;



&lt;div style="display:block;height:10px;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;div id="title-big"&gt;Sitewide Image Promotion&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;div class="four"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;div id="words-big"&gt;No matter which Featured Ad Option you choose, we will look to see if you have good photos with your ad. If you do, we will add the best one to the random display of Featured Ad images that readers see at the top of each category and the front page. This will increase the number of eyes looking at your ad by orders of magnitude.&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;div class="eight"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;div id="words-big"&gt;Everybody knows that we often buy things that we weren't searching for to begin with. In fact, a lot of times, we don't even know we want something until we see it. That's just human nature. So, reaching out to folks who are visiting the front page, or browsing through different categories, and showing them what you're offering, just makes a lot of sense.&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;div class="eight"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;div id="words-big"&gt;Basically, for what amounts to &lt;a href="/note/aptopics.html#Rates" onclick="return ns.htmlExpand(this, { objectType: 'ajax'} )"&gt;less than the price of a cup of coffee&lt;/a&gt;, you'll be able to continuously advertise everywhere on Alaska's List, and all you had to do was post a Featured Ad in order to do it. With over 25,000 people visiting the site every day, that's powerful, low-cost advertising potential you really shouldn't ignore.&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;/div&gt;











&lt;div id="CrossCatImage"&gt;



&lt;div style="display:block;height:10px;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;div class="four"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;div id="words-big"&gt;No matter which Featured Ad Option you might choose, we will look to see if you have good photos with your ad. If you do, we will add the best one to the random display of Featured Ad images that readers now see at the top of each category, and on the front page. This will increase the number of eyes looking at your ad by orders of magnitude.&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;div class="eight"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;div id="words-big"&gt;The front page is the busiest page at Alaska's List. Over 75% of all visitors come to Alaska's List using our front page as their starting point.

&lt;div id="words-big"&gt;Basically, for what amounts to &lt;a href="/note/aptopics.html#Rates" onclick="return ns.htmlExpand(this, { objectType: 'ajax'} )"&gt;less than the price of a cup of coffee&lt;/a&gt;, you'll get to continuously advertise everywhere on Alaska's List, and all you had to do was post a Featured Ad in order to do it. With over 25,000 people visiting the site every day now, that's powerful, low-cost advertising potential you really shouldn't ignore.&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;div class="eight"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;div id="words-big"&gt;Everyone knows that we often buy things that we weren't searching for to begin with. In fact, a lot of times, we don't even know we want something until we see it. It's just human nature. So, reaching out to folks who are visiting different categories, and showing them what you're offering, makes a lot of sense.&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;/div&gt;









&lt;div id="Google"&gt;



&lt;div style="display:block;height:10px;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;div id="title-big"&gt;Search Engine Visibility&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;div class="four"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;div id="words-big"&gt;You can never underestimate the importance of search engine visibility, and that's why we make sure that Featured Ads get seen first, not only by the readers who come directly to our site, but by the millions of users of Google and the other search engines like Bing and Yahoo.&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;div class="eight"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;div id="words-big"&gt;Optimizing our Featured Ads so that they rank as high as possible in Web searches is something we work hard at, because it's one of the most important things we can do to make Featured Ads a valuable advertising product.&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;div class="eight"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;div id="words-big"&gt;What this means is that whenever someone searches for something at Google or any of the other major search engines, and that user's query matches the content of your Featured Ad, it will likely show-up in the search results, provided the ad contains enough relevant information. This is a huge advantage you can only get when you post a Featured Ad.&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;div class="eight"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;div id="words-big"&gt;Since millions of people "Google" what their looking for on the Internet, posting a Featured Ad at a popular, high-traffic (Alaskan) Web site such as Alaska's List, where it will be found in Internet searches, is one of the most important things you can do as an online advertiser here in Alaska.&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;div class="eight"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;div id="words-big"&gt;Why is it so important that it be an "Alaskan" site? Because all of the major search engines have a page ranking system that they apply, which attempts to provide the most relevant results to their users, and a large part of that relevance is based upon geographic location.&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;div class="eight"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;div id="words-big"&gt;So, naturally, when someone is searching for something in Alaska, they will be delivered a list search results from the most highly ranked sites in Alaska first, because that content will more likely to be relevant to the searcher than say, content coming from a service located in California.&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;div style="display:block;height:10px;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;div class="twelve"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;div id="title-small"&gt;If you have a Web site, or need one...&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;div class="four"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;div id="words-big"&gt;Our search engine optimization is so good that, if you already have a Web site, you can expect to get a lot more traffic once you begin promoting it in your Featured Ad here at Alaska's List. Some Featured Advertisers have told us that over half of their Web site traffic comes from folks clicking over from their Featured Ad. This is what is known as "referrer traffic."&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;div class="eight"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;div id="words-big"&gt;Not only will more people be finding your Web site here, but its page rank with Google and the other search engines will also improve, simply because it has become linked to from a popular, high-traffic (Alaskan) Web site such Alaska's List. When you run a Web site, page rank is EVERYTHING, and anything you can do to improve it is money well spent.&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;div class="eight"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;div id="words-big"&gt;In fact, over the years, a few of our Featured Advertisers have actually shut down their Web sites altogether, after realizing it was a lot easier, and a lot more cost effective for them to maintain a Featured Ad here at Alaska's List than it was for them to keep a Web site up and promoted all of the time.&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;div class="eight"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;div id="words-big"&gt;After all, you could potentially maintain a Featured Ad here at Alaska's List that will perform better than your current Web site, or any that you could affordably build and promote, for only $39.56/year, which is a bargain.&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;div class="eight"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;div id="words-big"&gt;A Featured Ad at Alaska's List is better than a lonely Web site because you get to take advantage of the enormous amount of traffic we get here every day. So, for instance, if someone arrives here after finding one of our ads on Google, it's quite natural for that visitor to "look around" to see what else is being offered in that category, which can often lead to great results for our Featured Advertisers, because those visitors will generally only spend a short time here afterward, mostly looking at our Featured Ads. This, of course, is because most folks are busy, and Featured Ads are the easiest to browse, and the most qualified ads to respond to.&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;/div&gt;

























&lt;div id="ImageRec"&gt;



&lt;div style="display:block;height:10px;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;div id="title-big"&gt;Upload Your Best Image&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;div class="four"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;div id="words-big"&gt;Choose your best picture for uploading when you first post your ad. After you finish posting, you will be able to upload three more pictures to your ad using the tools we provide for you on your Ad Management Page.&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;div class="eight"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;div id="words-big"&gt;We have found that many users don't know how big their images are, and that when they try to upload four high resolution photos taken with today's high megapixel digital cameras, the posting will often fail because the images are too large, and because their upload speed is limited by their ISP. When this happens, it takes a really long time to post the ad, which can not only be very frustrating to the poster, it may even cause the post to fail entirely.&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;div class="eight"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;div id="words-big"&gt;High resolution photos taken with today's digital cameras can often produce enormous file sizes (over 4 Megabytes), and most folks are unaware that their upload speed is only a fraction of their ISP's advertised download speed. So, we've found that the best way to avoid this source of frustration is to just limit the number of pictures during the initial posting process to the best one.&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;div class="eight"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;div id="words-big"&gt;Everything goes a lot smoother when we do it this way, and it really doesn't make much difference if you upload them in a separate step, because you still have to wait on them to upload for the same reasons you do when you first post (upload speed and file size). At least, by doing it this way, the posting process goes more smoothly for everyone.&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;div class="eight"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;div id="words-big"&gt;Thank you for your understanding.&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;/div&gt;











&lt;div id="ViewRate"&gt;



&lt;div style="display:block;height:10px;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;div id="title-big"&gt;20:1 Better Page View Rate&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;div class="four"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;div id="words-big"&gt;After publishing our first 300,000 Alaskan classified ads for those first 22 million users who viewed them, we analyzed our logs and found that those visitors viewed Featured Ad pages twenty (20) times more often than other pages, which translates to a huge advantage.&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;div class="eight"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;div id="words-big"&gt;This is due to our excellent search optimization (SEO) of Featured Ads.&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;div class="eight"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;div id="words-big"&gt;Scores of people come directly to Featured Ads after finding them listed in their Google, Bing and Yahoo searches, which is why Featured Ads are viewed so much more often. If you want to reach out, and make your ad available to the millions of people who are constantly searching the Internet, you'll need a Featured Ad to get that done.&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;/div&gt;







&lt;div id="AntiSpam"&gt;



&lt;div style="display:block;height:10px;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;div id="title-big"&gt;Anti-Spam System&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;div class="four"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;div id="words-big"&gt;We work really hard at protecting users from the kind of unwanted e-mail Spam they get so much of at other sites, and we've become really good at it. In fact, we hardly ever get any abuse reports from advertisers who are using our Contact Form to receive e-mail responses to their ad.&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;div class="eight"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;div id="words-big"&gt;While it would be foolish for us to tell you how we do it, we will tell you that we have blocked, and continue to block, all known Spam sources we have encountered over the past five years which originated from networks in Non-English speaking countries. It's amazing what a huge difference this one step alone has made in the quality of responses that our advertisers receive when using our Contact Form.&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;/div&gt;







&lt;div id="QualifiedPremium"&gt;



&lt;div style="display:block;height:10px;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;





&lt;div class="four"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;div id="words-big"&gt;Let's face it. A little qualification can go a long way on the Net. When it is known by the reader that you paid a fee, even one &lt;a href="/note/aptopics.html#Rates" onclick="return ns.htmlExpand(this, { objectType: 'ajax'} )"&gt;as tiny as ours&lt;/a&gt; to run your ad, then you must be someone who is serious about what your advertising. That's why they look at Featured Ads first, because they know that, at Alaska's List, Featured Ads are the most "qualified" ads to respond to.&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;/div&gt;







&lt;div id="Qualified"&gt;



&lt;div style="display:block;height:10px;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;div id="title-big"&gt;Improved Reader Confidence&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;div class="four"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;div id="words-big"&gt;Let's face it. A little qualification can go a long way on the Net. When it is known by the reader that you paid a fee, even one &lt;a href="/note/aptopics.html#Rates" onclick="return ns.htmlExpand(this, { objectType: 'ajax'} )"&gt;as tiny as ours&lt;/a&gt; to run your ad, then you must be someone who is serious about what your advertising.&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;div class="eight"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;div id="words-big"&gt;That's why readers look at Featured Ads first, because they know, at Alaska's List, Featured Ads are the most "qualified" ads to respond to.&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;div class="eight"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;div id="words-big"&gt;Since a low-cost Featured Ad will qualify your ad as both legitimate and timely, it will improve the confidence level of the reader to respond to your ad, which increases the likelyhood that it will be successful.&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;/div&gt;





&lt;div id="QualifiedGuns"&gt;



&lt;div style="display:block;height:10px;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="four"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;div class="four"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;div id="words-big"&gt;Let's face it. A little qualification can go a long way on the Net. When it is known by the reader that you paid a fee, even one &lt;a href="/note/aptopics.html#RatesGuns" onclick="return ns.htmlExpand(this, { objectType: 'ajax'} )"&gt;as tiny as ours&lt;/a&gt; to run your ad, then you must be someone who is serious about what your advertising.&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;div class="eight"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;div id="words-big"&gt;That's why readers look at Featured Ads first, because they know, at Alaska's List, Featured Ads are the most "qualified" ads to respond to.&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;div class="eight"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;div id="words-big"&gt;Perhaps one of the biggest hurdles you have to overcome these days as an online advertiser is the "confidence hurdle." Many online shoppers, for good reason, have grown skeptical of the free listings they encounter online, and just won't respond to any that they think might be a waste of their time.&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;div class="eight"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;div id="words-big"&gt;So, anything you can do in order to qualify your ad as legitimate and timely, and improve the confidence level of the reader will give your ad a huge advantage, and increase the likelyhood that it will be successful.&lt;/div&gt;







&lt;/div&gt;







&lt;div id="QualifiedPremium"&gt;



&lt;div style="display:block;height:10px;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;div class="four"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;div id="words-big"&gt;Let's face it. A little qualification can go a long way on the Net. When it is known by the reader that you paid a fee, even one &lt;a href="/note/aptopics.html#RatesGuns" onclick="return ns.htmlExpand(this, { objectType: 'ajax'} )"&gt;as tiny as ours&lt;/a&gt; to run your ad, then you must be someone who is serious about what your advertising. That's why they look at Featured Ads first, because they know that, at Alaska's List, Featured Ads are the most "qualified" ads to respond to.&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;/div&gt;









&lt;div id="Offsite"&gt;



&lt;div style="display:block;height:10px;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;div id="title-big"&gt;Extensive Offsite Promotion&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;div class="four"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;div id="words-big"&gt;Every Alaskan knows that it's the fisherman who casts the widest net that catches the most fish. So, when Alaska's List promotes your Featured Ad off-site at great sites like &lt;a href="http://akweb.com" target="_blank"&gt;AKweb.com&lt;/a&gt;, we're making your advertising net even wider, which can only help you get better results.&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;/div&gt;





&lt;div id="Support"&gt;



&lt;div style="display:block;height:10px;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;div id="title-big"&gt;Unlimited Support&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;div class="four"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;div id="words-big"&gt;All of our advertisers get great e-mail support, but we think it's nice to be able to call someone who can help you with your ad whenever you need it, and that's exactly what you'll be able to do when you become a customer. Phone Support will be available to you 6:00 AM - 6:00 PM, and Chat/E-mail Support between 6:00 AM - Midnight (AK Time). &lt;b&gt;907-854-0910&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;div class="eight"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;div id="words-big"&gt;If you call, please don't be too shocked when you discover that a real human being answers the phone. It's just one of the many things that makes our site refreshingly different. We want everyone to know that it's real people who are making it happen here at Alaska's List, not the machines.&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;/div&gt;





&lt;div id="Service"&gt;



&lt;div style="display:block;height:10px;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;div id="title-big"&gt;Personal Attention and Service&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;div class="four"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;div id="words-big"&gt;Some advertisers don't need any help at all. They know just what they want, and how to get it done using Alaska's List. Other folks need more, and that's where you'll find us at our best; personally helping those who need it get the most out of their advertising in ways they never expected, but were always happy to discover.&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;/div&gt;







&lt;div id="Placement"&gt;



&lt;div style="display:block;height:10px;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;div id="title-big"&gt;Placement Advantages&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;div class="four"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;div id="words-big"&gt;Today's Internet shoppers are like everyone else: pressed for time, and there's a lot of competition for their limited attention. So, it only makes sense that you would want your ad at the top of the List where Featured Ads are presented, because that's where it's most likely to be seen by busy eyes.&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;div class="eight"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;div id="words-big"&gt;Not only are Featured Ads always displayed first to readers when they're browsing or searching Alaska's List. They're also displayed first to search engines like Google, Bing, and Yahoo,  which monitor and index Alaska's List continuously. In fact, when a new Featured Ad is placed, it's generally indexed by Google and Bing in only minutes, and then it is quickly made available to the millions of people who are searching those services.&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;/div&gt;









&lt;div id="Highlighting"&gt;



&lt;div style="display:block;height:10px;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;div id="title-big"&gt;Special Highlighting Effects&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;div class="four"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;div id="words-big"&gt;We spent years working out what the most ideal highlighting effects we could apply to our Featured Ads. Finally, we gave Featured Ads a much bigger and bolder typeface, an alternating backround, an extensive 327 character text preview, as well as an engaging image preview that compels users to focus their attention on your ad's preview image at the exclusion of all others, giving your ad the reader's undivided attention.&lt;/div&gt;





&lt;/div&gt;





&lt;div id="HighlightingGuns"&gt;



&lt;div style="display:block;height:10px;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;





&lt;div class="four"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;div id="words-big"&gt;We spent years working out what the most ideal highlighting effects we could apply to our Featured Ads. Finally, we gave Featured Ads a much bigger and bolder typeface than Free Ads, an alternating backround, and an extensive text preview.&lt;/div&gt;





&lt;/div&gt;













&lt;div id="Inactive"&gt;



&lt;div style="display:block;height:10px;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;div id="title-big"&gt;Current Status: Not Published&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;div class="four"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;div id="words-big"&gt;This ad is not currently activated for publication. Therefore, it cannot be viewed by readers, nor can it be seen by users of search services such as Google, Bing, and Yahoo, which index our site continuously.&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;div class="eight"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;div id="words-big"&gt;You can easily activate this ad by choosing one of our low-cost Featured Ad Options, and clicking the "Buy Featured Ad Time" button to checkout. After you do, your ad will be activated, and moved to the top of the List.&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;/div&gt;













&lt;div id="Popular"&gt;



&lt;div style="display:block;height:10px;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;div id="title-big"&gt;Site Statistics&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;div class="four"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;div id="words-big"&gt;We take pride in the number of visitors we get to our site every day, because that's what it's all about, putting as many eyes in front of the classified ads as we can. We know how to do that, and we do it well every day. In fact, we are so proud of our &lt;a href="javascript:window.open('http://alaskaslist.com/stats/','mywindow','location=1,status=1,scrollbars=1,width=720,height=620')" title="View Site Statistics"&gt;Web site's statistics&lt;/a&gt; that we have always made them publicly-available for everyone see since the first day we launched the site.

&lt;!--

How many other classifieds sites publish their raw statistics? None that we know of. --&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;div class="eight"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;div id="words-big"&gt;When looking at our stats, please be aware that they could be even bigger than they are, but we made a decision long ago to block most non-English speaking foreign countries from visiting Alaska's List. What this does is eliminate much of the problem you see at other sites, where illegitimate e-mail responses are so commonplace.&lt;/div&gt;





&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id="title-big"&gt;Free Ads are Powered by You&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;div class="four"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;





&lt;div id="words-big"&gt;We don't believe that advertising on the Internet should have to be like combat fishing. We understand that some things sell quickly, and that some things take longer. But, no matter how long it takes, we agree to keep your Free Ad in front of our readers, and to make sure that everyone follows our (once per item every 30 days) posting rules, and you, the Free Advertiser, agree to manage your ad responsibly by deleting it whenever you no longer need it. Not only is this a fair deal, we believe it's the most straightforward and hassle-free way to advertise on the Internet.&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;div class="eight"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;div id="words-big"&gt;When shopping at Alaska's List, always try to remember that just because an ad has been on the site for 5 minutes doesn't mean it's still for sale, and just because it's been on the site for a long time doesn't mean that it's not. A lot depends on the realities of supply and demand in the marketplace for a particular item. So, if you see an ad on Alaska's List, especially a Featured Ad, you should presume that the item is still available, and contact that advertiser if you're genuinely interested in what they're advertising.&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;div class="eight"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;div id="words-big"&gt;We think that's the beauty of Alaska's List; advertisers only have to post their ad once, without ever having to babysit it, or worry about it, and readers are able to look at Alaska's List as a comprehensive, ongoing inventory of what's really available in the marketplace; not just what those few, intrepid souls, who had to spend so much of their time re-posting their ad over and over again, were willing to post. There's really more out there than that.&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;div class="eight"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;div id="words-big"&gt;Not only do readers benefit from this broader look at our State's unique Marketplace, Alaska's advertisers are provided with a better way to advertise online than the stressful and time-consuming (and therefore costly) combat advertising arenas provided (free?) elsewhere.&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;div class="eight"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;div id="words-big"&gt;Thank you for your support.&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;/div&gt;











&lt;div id="Updated"&gt;



&lt;div style="display:block;height:10px;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;div id="words-big"&gt;The Last Updated date indicates either the last time the ad was actually edited by the user, or in the case of Free Ads that have been on the List for more than 30 days, it might indicate the the date that we last sent a notice to the poster, inviting him/her to delete their ad if they don't need it anymore. We do this automatically every thirty days with all Free Ads, because Free Ads run until the item sells, and do not expire like Featured Ads do.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id=words-big&gt;Your Free Ad expires whenever you delete it. When you post your ad, you agree that it will be your personal responsibility to delete your ad when you decide that you no longer need it. Until you do that, unless we have good reason to believe otherwise (e.g. date sensitive ads, puppy ads, moving sales, etc.), we will assume that your item is still for sale, and that's why you haven't deleted your ad yet. It's that simple. This is the most straightforward and hassle-free way to advertise something on the Internet, in our opinion.&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;div class=eight&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;div id=words-big&gt;We understand that some things sell right away, and that some things take a lot longer. Either way, you'll only have to post your ad at Alaska's List once, and we'll take care of keeping it in front of our readers for you until you decide you don't need it anymore.&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;div class=eight&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;div id=words-big&gt;You'll be able to delete your ad at any time by using the Ad Management tools we provide to you when you post your ad, or by sending us a Deletion Request via email.&lt;/div&gt;

Here, posters only have to post a Free Ad once, and we will run it until the item sells.&lt;/div&gt;
