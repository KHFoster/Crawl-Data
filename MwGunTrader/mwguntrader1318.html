There are a few cracks in the stock that a new owner may be interested in having repair professionally.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The appraised value AS IS was $1900.&amp;nbsp; If you had stock repaired, fixed trigger catch, and fixed the rear sight, estimated value would be $2500.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
