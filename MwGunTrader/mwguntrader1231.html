&lt;div class="list_table"&gt;&lt;div class="ad_table_light_cell ad_descr" style="text-align:left;padding:3px;margin:0 1px 0 1px;"&gt;I have a like new FN ps90 that's only had 200 rds through it, comes with 8-50rd mags and 1-30rd mag....mags are brand new...6 are still in the box...gun also has a Sig Sauer magnified, illuminated optic on it....gun is in mint condition....I also have a lnib FN 5.7 that's only had 200 rds through it as well...and comes with 7 new 20rd mags and 2 new pro mag 30rd mags and also a brand new fn 30rd mag extension that's still in the package....and also comes with a 200 dollar leather shoulder holster that holds gun and 2 extra mags.....If you're wanting to get into the 5.7x28 rd then this is the perfect setup, I'm very meticulous about my things and my guns are in perfect condition, these both were taken to the range twice then cleaned and have been safe Queens ever since....if I had to put a value on this package it would probably be between 3500-4k with all the extras....I'm just seeing what's out there, I have doubles of both of these guns....cash or trade, things I like would be Scar 16, Scar 17, FNX 45 tactical, FN, Sig, HK, M1A, bulk ammo.. gun calibers I prefer are 9mm, 45, 5.56, 223, 308, maybe a 50 cal...just shoot me an offer worst I can say is no thanks.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
